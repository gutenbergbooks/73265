  <h2 class='c002'>MODERN LIGHT LITERATURE—POETRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Poets,” said the ancient wisdom,
“are not made, but born.” We have
made miraculous progress in all the
arts of manufacture since the time of
this saying, but we have not been
able to controvert the judgment of
our forefathers. Education, refinement,
taste, and talent, are great
things in their way, and men do
wonders with them; but we have
not fallen yet upon a successful method
of bringing down the divine
spark into the marble, let us work it
ever so curiously. The celestial gift
in these new times, as in the old,
comes down with divine impartiality,
yet seldom into the tenement most
specially built and garnished for its
reception. We can make critics, connoisseurs,
“an enlightened audience,”
but, let us labour at it as we will, we
cannot make a poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>And indeed, to tell the truth, it is
but small help we can give, with all
our arts and ingenuities, even to the
perfecting of the poet born. Science
discusses the subject gravely—at one
time troubled with apprehensions lest
her severe shadow should kill the
singer outright, as Reason killed Love—at
another, elate with the happier
thought of increasing all his conquests,
and sending forth as her own
esquire, bearing her ponderous lance
and helmet, the glorious boy in his
perennial youth. It is a vain speculation.
The poet glances past this
important figure with a calm eye and
a far-shining smile. His vocation is
beyond and beyond the range of all
the sciences. The heart and soul
that were in the first home, ere ever
even spade and distaff were invented,
when two forlorn hopeful creatures,
wistfully looking back to the sunset
of Eden, wistfully looking forward to
the solemn nightfall of the drear
world without, with all its starry
promises of another morning and a
higher heaven, were all the human
race—are world and scope enough for
the humanest and most divine of arts.
That God has made of one blood all
the nations and all the generations of
this many-peopled earth, is the argument
on which he speaks; that heart
answers unto heart all the world over,
is the secret of his power. The petulant
passion of a child, the heroisms
and exultations and agonies of that
fantastical sweet youth, over whose
unconscious mockery of our real conflict
we graver people smile and weep,
are of more import to the poet than
all the secrets of the earth, and all
the wonders of the sky; and he turns—it
is his vocation—from the discovery
of a planet, forgetting all about
it, to make the whole world ring with
joy over a cottage cradle, or weigh
down the very wings of the winds
with wailing over some uncommemorated
grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, it is a humiliating confession—but
in reality we are quite as like to
injure as to elevate our poet by all
our educations. Perhaps the heavenly
glamour in his eyne had best
be left entirely unobscured by any
laws save those of nature; but at all
events it seems tolerably sure, that
the more we labour at his training,
the less satisfactory is the result of it.
A school of poets is the most hopeless
affair in existence; and whether it
dwindle into those smallest of small
rhymsters, leaden echoes of the silver
chimes of Pope, in whom the eighteenth
century delighted, or to the
present makers of dislocated verses,
whose glory it is to break stones upon
the road where the Laureate’s gilded
coach flashes by, we wait with equal
weariness and equal impatience for
the Coming Man, who knows neither
school nor education—whose business
it is to rout the superannuated spinsters,
and make the world ring once
more with the involuntary outburst
of song and youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we who are but the unhappy
victims of the mania, why do we
blame ourselves? Alas! it is not we,
but our poets, foolish fraternity, who
have set about this fatal task of making
a school and perfecting themselves
in their art. How do you suppose
they are to do it, kindest reader?
In other arts and professions the
self-love of the student in most instances
suffers a woeful downfall at
his very outset. Tutors and books,
dire conspirators against his innocence,
startle the hapless neophyte
out of all his young complacency;
professors set him down calmly as a
know-nothing; chums, with storms
of laughter, drive him out of his last
stronghold. He has to shut himself
out from his college doors; seal himself
up, poor boy, in his home letters,
and so sit down and study other
people’s wisdom, till he comes by
that far away and roundabout process
to some true estimate of his
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the poet, say the poets, needs
other training. For him it is safest
that we shut him up with himself.
Himself, a separated creature, garlanded
and crowned for the sacrifice,
is, in one noble concentration, all the
ethics, the humanity, and the religion
with which he has to do; significances,
occult and mysterious, are in
every breath of wind that whispers
about his dedicated head; his smallest
actions are note-worthy, his sport is a
mystery, his very bread and cheese
symbolical. He is a poet—everywhere,
and in all places, it is the
destiny of this unfortunate to reverence
himself, to contemplate himself,
to expound and study the growth
of a poet’s mind, the impulses of a
poet’s affections; he is not to be permitted
to be unconscious of the sweet
stirrings within him of the unspoken
song; he is not to be allowed to
believe with that sweetest simplicity
of genius that every other youthful
eye beholds “the light that never
was on sea or land,” as well as his
own. Unhappy genius! ill-fated
poet! for him alone of all men must
the heavens and the earth be blurred
over with a miserable I,—and so he
wanders, a woeful Narcissus, seeing
his own image only, and nothing
better, in all the lakes and fountains;
and, bound by all the canons of his
art, falls at last desperately either in
love or in hate with the persistent
double, which, go where he will, still
looks him in the face.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we bethink us of the greater
poets, sons of the elder time. There
was David, prince of lyric-singers;
there was Shakespeare, greatest
maker among men. The lyricist was
a king, a statesman, a warrior, and a
prophet; the leisure of his very youth
was the leisure of occupation, when
the flocks were feeding safe in the
green pastures, and by the quiet
waters; and even then the dreaming
poet-eye had need to be wary, and
sometimes flashed into sudden lightning
at sight of the lion which the
stripling slew. <em>He</em> sung out of the
tumult and fulness of his heart—out
of the labours, wars, and tempests of
his most human and most troubled
life: his business in this world was
to live, and not to make poems. Yet
what songs he made! They are Holy
Writ, inspired and sacred; yet they
are human songs, the lyrics of a
struggling and kingly existence—the
overflow of the grand primal human
emotions to which every living heart
resounds. His “heart moved him,”
his “soul was stirred within him”—true
poet-heart—true soul of inspiration!
and not what other men might
endure, glassed in the mirror of his
own profound poetic spirit, a study
of mankind; but of what himself was
bearing there and at that moment,
the royal singer made his outcry,
suddenly, and “in his haste,” to God.
What cries of distress and agony are
these! what bursts of hope amid
the heartbreak! what shouts and
triumphs of great joy! For David
did not live to sing, but sang because
he strove and fought, rejoiced and suffered,
in the very heart and heat of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us say a word of King David
ere we go further. Never crowned
head had so many critics as this man
has had in these two thousand years;
and many a scorner takes occasion by
his failings, and religious lips have
often faltered to call him “the man
after God’s own heart;” yet if we
would but think of it, how touching
is this name! Not the lofty and philosophic
Paul, though his tranced
eyes beheld the very heaven of
heavens; not John, although the
human love of the Lord yearned towards
that vehement angel-enthusiast,
whose very passion was for
God’s honour; but on this sinning,
struggling, repenting David, who
fights and falls, and rises only to fall
and fight again—who only never will
be content to lie still in his overthrow,
and acknowledge himself vanquished—who
bears about with him every
day the traces of some downfall, yet
every day is up again, struggling on
as he can, now discouraged, now
desperate, now exultant; who has a
sore fighting life of it all his days,
with enemies within and without, his
hands full of wars, his soul of
ardours, his life of temptations. Upon
this man fell the election of Heaven.
And small must his knowledge be,
of himself or of his race, who is not
moved to the very soul to think upon
God’s choice of this David, as the
<em>man</em> after His own heart. Heaven
send us all as little content with our
sins as had the King of Israel! Amen.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then there is Shakespeare:
never man among men, before or
after him, has made so many memorable
people; yet amid all the crowding
faces on his canvass, we cannot
point to one as “the portrait of the
painter.” He had leisure to make
lives and histories for all these
men and women, but not to leave a
single personal token to us of himself.
The chances seem to be, that
this multitudinous man, having so
many other things to think of,
thought marvellously little of William
Shakespeare; and that all that
grave, noble face would have brightened
into mirthfullest laughter had he
ever heard, in his own manful days,
of the Swan of Avon.  His very
magnitude, so to speak, lessens him
in our eyes; we are all inclined to
be apologetic when we find him
going home in comfort and good
estate, and ending his days neither
tragically nor romantically, but in
ease and honour. He is the greatest
of poets, but he is not what you call
a poetical personage. He writes his
plays for the <cite>Globe</cite>, but, once begun
upon them, thinks only of his Hamlet
or his Lear, and not a whit of
his audience; nor, in the flush and
fulness of his genius, does a single
shadow of himself cross the brilliant
stage, where, truth to speak, there is
no need of him. The common conception
of a poet, the lofty, narrow,
dreamy soul, made higher and more
abstract still by the glittering crown
of light upon his crested forehead,
is entirely extinguished in the broad
flood of sunshine wherein stands
this Shakespeare, a common man,
sublimed and radiant in a very
deluge and overflow of genial power.
Whether it be true or not that these
same marvellous gifts of his would
have made as great a statesman or
as great a philosopher as they made
a poet, it does not lie in our way to
discover; but to know that the
prince of English poets did his work,
which no man has equalled, with as
much simplicity and as little egotism
as any labouring peasant of his
time—to see him setting out upon it
day by day, rejoicing like a strong
man to run a race, but never once
revealing to us those laborious
tokens of difficulties overcome, which
of themselves, as Mr Ruskin says,
are among the admirable excellences
of Art—to perceive his ease and
speed of progress, and how his occupation
constantly is with his story
and never with himself,—what a
lesson it is! But alas, and alas! we
are none of us Shakespeares. Far
above <em>his</em> motives, we would scorn to
spend our genius on a Globe Theatre,
or on any other vulgar manner of
earning daily bread. The poet is a
greater thing than his poem; let us
take <em>it</em> solely as an evidence of his
progress; and in the mean time,
however he may tantalise the world
with his gamut and his exercises,
let all the world look on with
patience, with awe, and with admiration.
True, he is not making an
Othello or a Hamlet; but never
mind, he is making Himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet the thought will glide in
upon us woefully unawares,—What
the better are we? We are ever so
many millions of people, and only
a hundred or two of us at the
utmost can be made happy in the
personal acquaintanceship of Mr
Tennyson or (we humbly crave the
Laureate’s pardon for the conjunction)
Mr Dobell. In this view
of the question, it is not near so
important to us that these gentlemen
should perfect the poet, as that
they should make the poem. We
ask the Laureate for a battle-song,
and he gives us a skilful fantasia
upon the harp; we hush our breath
and open our ears, and, listening
devoutly to the “Eureka!” of here
and there a sanguine critic, who has
found a poet, wait, longing for
the lay that is to follow. Woe is
upon us!—all that we can hear in
the universal twitter is, that every
man is trying his notes. We are
patient, but we are not a stoic; and
in the wrath of our disappointment
are we not tempted a hundred times to
plunge these melodious pipes into the
abyss of our waste-paper basket, and
call aloud for <cite>Punch</cite>, and the <cite>Times</cite>?</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, that great poetic rebel, Wordsworth,
has heavier sins upon his head
than Betty Foy and Alice Fell; it is
to him we owe it, that the poet in
these days is to be regarded as a delicate
monster, a creature who lives
not life but poetry, a being withdrawn
out of the common existence, and
seeing its events only in the magic
mirror of his own consciousness, as
the Lady of Shallott saw the boats
upon the river, and the city towers
burning in the sun. The Poet of the
Lakes had no imaginary crimes to tell
the world of, nor does it seem that he
regarded insanity as one of the
highest and most poetic states of man;
but we venture to believe there never
would have been a <cite>Balder</cite>, and
<cite>Maud</cite> should have had no crazy lover,
had there been no Recluse, solemnly
living a long life for Self and Poetry
in the retired and sacred seclusion of
Rydal Mount.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is in this way that the manner
which is natural and a necessity to
some one great spirit, becomes an intolerable
bondage and oppression to
a crowd of smaller ones. The solemn
egotism, self-reserved and abstract,
which belonged to Wordsworth, is
more easily copied than the broad,
bright, manful nature of our greatest
English poet, who was too mighty to
be peculiar; and the delusion has
still a deeper root.  It is in our
nature, as it seems, to scorn what is
familiar and common to all the world;
priesthoods, find them where you will,
are bound to profess a more ethereal
organisation, and seek a separated atmosphere.
Wordsworth is a very good
leader; but for a thorough out-and-out
practical man, admitting no compromise
with his theory, commend us
to Anthony the Eremite, the first of
all monkish deserters from this poor
sinking vessel, the world. The poet
is the priest of Nature; out with him
from this Noah’s ark of clean and unclean,—this
field of wheat and tares,
growing together till the harvest,—this
ignoble region of common life.
Let the interpreter betake him to his
monastery, his cloister, his anchorite’s
cell—and when he is there?
Yes, when he is there—he will sing to
us poor thralls whom he has left behind,
but not of our ignoble passions
and rejoicings, or the sorrows that
rend our hearts. Very different from
our heavy-handed troubles, rough
troopers in God’s army of afflictions,
are the spectre shapes of this poetic
world. True, their happiness is rapture,
their misery of the wildest,
their remorse the most refined; but
the daylight shines through and
through these ghostly people, and
leaves nothing of them but bits of
cloud. Alas, the preaching is vain
and without profit! What can the
poet do—when he is tired of his
<cite>Mystic</cite>, sick of his <cite>Balder</cite>, weary
of Assyrian bulls and lords with
rabbit-mouths? Indeed, there seems
little better left for him than what
his predecessors did before. The
monk spent his soul upon some
bright-leaved missal, and left the record
of his life in the illumination of
an initial letter, or the border of foliage
on a vellum page; the poet
throws away his in some elaborate
chime of words, some new inverted
measure, or trick of jingling syllables.
Which is the quaintest? for it is easy
to say which is the saddest waste of
the good gifts of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>Also it is but an indifferent sign of
us, being, as we undoubtedly are, so
far as poetry is concerned, a secondary
age, that there can be no dispute
about the first poet of our day.
There is no elder brotherhood to compete
for the laurel; no trio like Wordsworth,
Coleridge, and Southey; no
guerilla like Byron to seize upon the
contested honour, nor Irish minstrel
to strike a sugared note of emulation.
Should a chance arrow at this moment
strike down our poetic champion,
so far from comforting ourselves,
like King Henry, that we have “five
hundred as good as he,” we could not
find for our consolation one substitute
for Tennyson. Echoes of him
we could indeed find by the score;
but no one his entire equal in all
the field. Let no one say we do not
appreciate poetry; in these mechanical
days there are still a goodly number
of singers who could echo that
unfortunate admission which cost
Haverillo his life, and was the last
stroke of exasperation to the redoubtable
Firmilian, “I have a third
edition in the press.” But in spite of
Smith and Dobell, the Brownings
and the Mystics, our Laureate holds
his place; holding his laurel with
justice and right less disputable than
most of his predecessors. Yet our
admiration of Tennyson is perplexed
and unsatisfactory. He is the first
in his generation, but out of his generation
he does not bear comparison
with any person of note and fame
equal to his own. He is small in the
presence of Wordsworth, a very inferior
magician indeed by the side of
Coleridge; his very music—pardon
us, all poets and all critics!—does
not <em>flow</em>. It may be melodious, but
it is not winged; one stanza will
not float into another. It is a rosary
of golden beads, some of them gemmed
and radiant, fit to be set in a
king’s crown; but you must tell them
one by one, and take leisure for your
comment while they drop from your
fingers. They are beautiful, but they
leave you perfectly cool and self-possessed
in the midst of your admiration.
To linger over them is a
necessity; it becomes them to be
read with criticism; you go over the
costly beadroll and choose your single
favourites here and there, as you
might do in a gallery of sculpture.
And thus the poet chooses to make
you master of his song,—<em>it</em> does
not seize upon <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a kind and manner of influence
which poets have not often
aimed at. Hitherto it has been the
object of this fraternity to arrest and
overpower their audience as the
Ancient Mariner fascinated the wedding
guest; and we all know how
helplessly, and with what complete
submission, we have followed in the
train of these enchanters, wheresoever
it pleased them to turn their
wayward footsteps. But Mr Tennyson
aims at a more refined and subtle
influence than this downright enslaving.
A poet who writes, or
seems to write, because he cannot
help it,—and a poet who writes, or
seems to write, of set purpose and
<i><span lang="it">malice prepense</span></i>, are two very different
persons. A man of the first
class could not have written <cite>In
Memoriam</cite>. Had <em>he</em> been mourning,
he must have mourned a closer
grief, and broken his heart over it,
ere he had wept the half of those
melodious tears; but for the poet
quietly selecting a subject for his
poem, the wisest philosopher could
not have suggested a better choice.
A great deal has been said and written
on this subject, and we are fully
aware that grief does not make
books, or even poems, except in very
rare and brief instances, and that
the voice of a great sorrow is a sharp
and bitter outcry, and not a long
and eloquent monologue. But Mr
Tennyson does not present himself
to us under the strong and violent
compulsion of a great sorrow. It is
not grief at his heart which makes
him speak, using his gifts to give
ease and utterance to its burden of
weeping; but it is himself who uses
his grief, fully perceiving its capabilities,
and the entrance it will give
him into the sacred and universal
sympathy of his fellows. For, like
all great works of art, this poem
appeals to one of the primitive and
universal emotions of human nature.
The dead—the early dead, the beloved,
the gifted, the young: we
may discuss the appropriateness of
the tribute, but we cannot refuse to
be moved by its occasion. No man
can look on these pages without finding
here and there a verse which
strikes home; for few of us are happy
enough to live so much as twenty
years in this weary world of ours
without some <cite>In Memoriam</cite> of our
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet we cannot complain of Mr
Tennyson that he makes merchandise
of any of the nearest and closest bereavements,
the afflictions which
shake the very balance of the world
to those who suffer them. His sorrow
is as much of the mind as of the
heart; he weeps a companion beloved,
yet almost more honoured and
esteemed than beloved—a friend, not
even a brother, still less a child or a
wife;—enough of the primitive passion
to claim sympathy from all of us,
but not so much that our sympathy
loses itself in a woe beyond consolation.
Pure friendship is seldom so impassioned;
but had it been a commoner
tie—a relationship more usual—these
gradual revelations of grief in all its
successive phases must have been too
much at once for the poet and his
audience. This nice discrimination
secures for us that we are able to
read and follow him into all those
solemn regions of thought and fancy
which open at the touch of death;
<em>he</em> does not fall down upon the grave,
the threshold, as we are but too
like to do, and we wander after him
wistfully, beguiled with the echo of
this thoughtful weeping, which must
have overpowered us had it been as
close or as personal as our own. We
feel that over our own minds these
same thoughts have flashed now and
then—a momentary gleam—while we
were wading in the bitter waters,
and woefully making up our minds,
a hundred times in an hour, to the
will of God; but who could follow
them out? The poet, more composed,
does what we could not do; he makes
those flashes of hope or of agony into
pictures visible and true. Those
glimpses of the face of the dead, of
the moonlight marking out upon the
marble the letters of his name, those
visions of his progress now from
height to height in the pure heavens,
all the inconsistent lights and shadows—mingled
thoughts of the silence
in the grave, and of the sound
and sunshine of heaven—not one of
them is passed over. People say it
is not one poem, but a succession of
poems. It must have been so, or it
would not have been true. One
after another they come gleaming
through the long reverie of grief—one
after another, noting well their inconsistencies,
their leaps from day to
night, from earth to heaven, the poet
has set them down. He knows that
we think of the lost, in the same instant,
as slumbering under the sod
and as awaking above the sky;
he knows that we realise them <em>here</em>
and <em>there</em>, as living and yet as dead;
he knows that our</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“fancy fuses old and new,</div>
      <div class='line'>And flashes into false and true,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mingles all without a plan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is the excellence of <cite>In Memoriam</cite>
that it is a succession of poems—that
the thread of connection runs
loosely—now and then drops, and
as unexpectedly comes to light again—that
the sequence of these fancies
knows no logic, and that they come
in the strain as they come to the
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time it is equally true
that all this is done of set purpose
and intention—that the act with
which, glimpse by glimpse, the whole
tearful chronicle is made visible, is a
calm deliberate act, and not a voice
out of the present passion of a heartbreaking
grief. The poet has chosen
the theme—it is not the theme which
urges with an overpowering impulse
the utterance of the poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so it is with all Mr Tennyson’s
verses, for—no disparagement
to his poetic power—verses we must
call them. It is true he is now and
then moved by some sudden exclamation,
and shouts it out with an unexpected
force which startles his readers,
for the moment, into a more eager
sympathy—but for the most part this
poet holds his verse in perfect subordination,
and is never overcome or
led away by it. His poetry is <em>made</em>,
it is not born. When he can round
a sentence into a stanza, the effect,
of its kind, is perfect; but the very
form of his favourite measure, the
rhythm of <cite>In Memoriam</cite>, is against
any real outburst of involuntary
song; for the verse which falls so
sweetly when it contains all that belongs
to it within its perfect crystal
round, like a dewdrop, makes only a
most blurred and unshapely strain
when it has to eke out its sense
with another and another stanza.
When the necessities of his subject
force him to this, the poet labours
like a man threading together a succession
of fish-ponds in hopes of making
a river. Of themselves these
silvery globes are perfect, but there
is no current in them, and, work as
you will, they can never flow and
glow into a living stream. Yes, our
Laureate unhappily is always far too
much “master of his subject;” would
that his subject now and then could
but master him!</p>

<p class='c009'>If it should happen, by any chance,
that Mr Tennyson shared in Wordsworth’s
solemn conceit, and designed
to make a Gothic cathedral out of
his works and life, we marvel much
what place in it could be given to <cite>The
Princess</cite>, that prettiest of poetic extravagances.
Not a Lady-chapel,
though it is of a college of ladies that
the story treats—not a delicate shrine,
all wrought in lilies and graces of
foliage, like the shrine of some sweet
maiden-saint. No; the Marys, the
Catherines, and the Margarets, symbolised
an entirely different fashion
of womankind; yet have we the
greatest kindness for Ida in her girlish
heroics, sincerest of all fictions—in her
grand words, and her pride, her inconstant
subjects, and her own self-betraying
heart. For our own part,
we are so entirely weary of symbols,
that we do not pause to inquire
whether <cite>The Princess</cite> means anything
more than it professes to mean.
To us it is only a pleasant picture of
the phantasies of youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sweet and daring folly of
girlish heroics and extravagance has
not done half so much service to the
poet and story-teller as has the corresponding
stage in the development
of man. Yet there is more innocence
in it, and perhaps in its full bloom
its pretensions are even more sublime.
The delicate temerity which dares
everything, yet at its very climax
starts away in a little sudden access
of fear—the glorious young stoic,
who could endure a martyrdom, yet
has very hard ado to keep from crying
when you lose her favourite book
or break her favourite flower—the
wild enthusiast dreamer, scorning all
authorities, who yet could not sleep
o’ nights if she had transgressed by
ever so little the sweet obedience of
home,—there is a charm about this
folly almost more delightful than the
magic of the bolder youth, with all
its bright vagaries; and it is this
which makes our tenderness for the
Princess Ida and all her “girl graduates
in their golden hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange enough, however, this
phase of youthfulness does not seem
to have struck any woman-poet. We
have heroines pensive and heroines
sublime, heroines serious and heroines
merry, but very few specimens of that
high fantastical which embraces all
these, and into which most men, and
doubtless most women, on their way
to soberer life, have the luck to fall.
Mrs Browning is too sad, too serious,
too conscious of the special pangs and
calamities which press heaviest on her
sisterhood, to take note of any happier
peculiarity. Nor is this special
eye to feminine troubles confined to
Mrs Browning: a weeping and a
melancholy band are the poetesses of
all generations. “Woman is the
lesser man,” says the Laureate; but
only woman is the sadder man—the
victim set apart on a platform of
injury—the wronged and slighted
being whose lot it is to waste her
sweetness on hearts unkind and ungrateful,
say all the ladies. “<em>Her</em>
lot is on you.” The mature woman
has no better thought, when she looks
over the bright girl-heads, bent in
their morning prayer; and wherever
we have a female singer, there stands
woman, deject and pensive, betrayed,
forsaken, unbeloved, weeping immeasurable
tears. Is a woman, then,
the only creature in God’s universe
whom He leaves without compensation?
Out upon the thought! but
there ought to be some Ida bold
enough to proclaim the woman’s
special happinesses—the exuberant
girl-delights—the maiden meditation,
fancy free—the glory of motherhood—the
blessings as entirely her own
as are the griefs. <cite>Bertha in the
Lane</cite> is a most moving story, sweetly
told; but ye are not always weeping,
O gentlest sisterhood! and where are
your songs of joy?</p>

<p class='c009'>If Mr Tennyson intends the hysterical
folly of <cite>Maud</cite> for a companion
picture to this one, he is indeed elevating
the woman to a higher pedestal
than even Ida dreamed of; for
the youth is a miserable conception
in comparison with this sunbright
girl. In the beginning of the last
reign of poets—when men, disturbed
by the great rustle of the coming
wings, endeavoured to find out
wherein the magic consisted, to
which they could not choose but
yield—we remember to have seen
many clever speculations on the nature
of poetry “One said it was the
moon—another said nay”; and it
was very hard to understand the
unreasonable potency of this enchantment—which,
indeed, clever
people, unwilling to yield to an influence
which they cannot measure,
are perpetually accounting for by
rules and principles of art. “It has
always been our opinion,” says Lord
Jeffrey, “that the very essence of
poetry, apart from the pathos, the
wit, or the brilliant description which
may be embodied in it, but may exist
equally in prose, consists in the fine
perception and vivid expression of
that subtle and mysterious analogy
which exists between the physical
and the moral world—which makes
outward things and qualities the
natural types and emblems of inward
gifts and emotions, and leads us to
ascribe life and sentiment to everything
that interests us in the aspects
of external nature.” Lord Jeffrey
is a good authority, though sometimes
this troublesome poetry put
even the accomplished critic out of his
reckoning; but we are sadly afraid
that this deliverance of his, or at
least the idea it contains, has had
some share in the present insanity
of all our poets in regard to Nature.
Mr Tennyson may have a private
reason of his own for making such a
miserable grumbler as his last hero.
Mr Dobell may hold himself justified,
in the heights of self-complacence,
and for the benefit of art, for his
atrocious <cite>Balder</cite>, a criminal, by all
poetic laws, for prosiness interminable,
worse than murder; but we
would crave to know what right
these gentlemen may have to seize
upon our genial nature, and craze
her healthful looks and voices to
their hysterical and ghastly fancy?
We are content, if he uses his own
materials, that the Laureate should
dabble his hollow with blood to his
heart’s content; but we will not consent,
for a hundred laureates, to make
the free heather of our hills, the
kindly blossom sacred to home and
to liberty, an image of disgust and
horror. After all, this is a very poor
trick and a contemptible—at its best
much like that which Mr Ruskin denounces
as the most ignoble thing in
painting, the excitement of mind
which comes from a successful deception,
the consciousness that the
thing we look at is not what it
appears to be. When we feel Nature
sympathising with us, it is well; but
it is not well when we force her to
echo our own mad fancies, of themselves
forced and unreal enough. The
“frantic rain,” the “shuddering
dark,” the “maddened beach”—alas,
poor poets! is force of expression not
to be found by better means than by
this juggle of misplaced adjectives?
How widely different was the “sea
change into something rich and
strange” of the sweeter imagination
and the greater heart!</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is doubtless a very perturbed
atmosphere in which we find ourselves
when we come face to face
with the last new arrival in the land
of poesy, the unfortunate young gentleman
whose hard fate it is to love
Maud, and to shoot her brother. He
has no name, this ill-fated youth;
but doubtless Balder is reckoned in
his roll of cousinships, and so is Mr
Alexander Smith. There are three
of them, ladies and gentlemen, and
they are an amiable trio. Strangely
as their garb and intentions are altered,
there is a lingering reminiscence
about them of a certain <cite>Childe
Harold</cite> who once set the world
aflame. Like him they are troubled
with a weight of woe and misfortune
mysteriously beyond the conception
of common men; but unlike him—and
the difference is characteristic—these
unhappy lads are solemnly bent
on “improving their minds,” in spite
of their misery. For our own part,
we are much disposed, in the first
instance, to set down <cite>Maud</cite> as one
of the greatest impertinences ever
perpetrated by a poet; but we confess,
after an hour’s trial of <cite>Balder</cite>,
and the ceaseless singing of that wife
of his, which of itself certainly was
almost enough to drive a sober man
crazy, and ought to be received as
an extenuating circumstance, we return
in a kinder spirit to the nameless
young gentleman who wrote the
Laureate’s poem. After all, he is
only an idle boy, scorning other
people, as idle boys are not unwont
to scorn their neighbours in the
world; he does not think himself a
divinity; he has not a manuscript at
hand to draw forth and gaze upon
with delighted eyes; he is not—let
us be grateful—a poet. His history
is all pure playing with the reader,
a wanton waste of our attention and
the singer’s powers; but, after all,
there is something of the breath of
life in it, when we compare it with
the solemn foolery of its much-pretending
contemporaries, the lauds of
the self-worshipping man, or the
rhapsodies of the self-admiring youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>We remember to have heard a
very skilful painter of still life describe
how the composition, the light
and shade, and arrangement of one
of his pictures, was taken from a
great old picture of a scriptural
scene. Instead of men and women,
the story and the action of the original,
our friend had only things inanimate
to group upon his canvass,
but he kept the arrangement, the
sunshine and the shadow, the same.
One can suppose that some such artistic
whim had seized upon Mr Tennyson.
In the wantonness of conscious
power, he has been looking about
him for some feat to do—when, lo!
the crash of a travelling orchestra
smote upon the ears of the poet. Are
there German bands in the Isle of
Wight? or was it the sublimer music
of some provincial opera which woke
the Laureate’s soul to this deed of
high emprise? Yes, <cite>Maud</cite> is an
overture done into words; beginning
with a jar and thunder—all the
breath of all the players drawn out
in lengthened suspiration upon the
noisy notes; then bits of humaner
interlude—soft flute-voices—here and
there a momentary silvery trumpet-note,
or the tinkle of a harp, and
then a concluding crash of all the instruments,
a tumult of noises fast
and furious, an assault upon our ears
and our patience, only endurable because
we see the end. Such is this
poem—which indeed it is sad to call
a poem, especially in those hard days.
We mean no disparagement to Mr
Tennyson’s powers. It is perhaps
only when we compare this with
other poems of the day that we see
how prettily managed is the thread
of the story, and how these morsels
of verse carry us through every scene
as clear as if every scene was a picture;
but a man who knows only too
consciously that a whole nation of
people acknowledge him as their best
singer—a man who also doubtless
must have noted how the good public,
those common people who take
their ill names so tenderly, hurry his
books into sixth and tenth editions,
a fact which ought somewhat to
counterbalance the cheating yard-wand—and
one, moreover, so thoroughly
acquainted with the gravity
and passion of this time, and how it
has been startled into a humbler estimate
of itself by the fiery touch of
war,—that such a man, at such an
hour, should send forth this piece of
trifling as his contribution to the
courage and heartening of his country,
is as near an insult to the audience
he addresses as anything which
is not personal can be.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Tennyson, however, has insight
and perception to keep him
from the strand on which his imitators—the
smaller people who endeavour
to compete with him in
poetry, and triumphantly excel him
in extravagance—go ashore. <em>He</em>
knows that a poet’s hero ought
not to be a poet—that a man’s
genius was given him, if not for
the glory of God, its best aim, yet,
at worst, for the glory of some
other man, and not for the pitiful
delight of self-laudation, meanest of
human follies. A great book is a
great thing, and a great poem is the
most immortal of great books; yet,
notwithstanding, one cannot help a
smile at the “Have you read my
book?” of Mr Smith’s <cite>Life Drama</cite>,
or the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O thou first last work! my early planned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Long meditate, and slowly-written epic,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>of Mr Dobell! The poet’s glory is
to celebrate other achievements than
his own. His inspiration is the generous
flush of sympathy which triumphs
in another’s triumph: “Arms
and the man I sing;” and so it becomes
him to throw his heart into
his subject, and leave his own reputation
with a noble indifference to
the coming ages, who will take care
of that. But it is a perilous day for
poetry when poets magnify their office
through page after page of lengthy
argument—not to say, besides, that
it is very unjust to us, who are not
poets but common people, and cannot
be expected to follow into these
recondite regions the soaring wing of
genius. The greater can comprehend
the less, but not the less the
greater. <em>He</em> can descend to us in
our working-day cares, but it is not
to be expected that many of us can
ascend to him in that sublime retirement
of his among the visions and
the shadows. To take <cite>Balder</cite>, for
instance: marvellously few of us,
even at our vainest, think either
kings or gods of ourselves; ordinary
human nature, spite of its prides and
pretensions, is seldom without a consciousness
at its heart of its own littleness
and poverty; and when we
hear a man declaring his sublime
superiority, we are puzzled, and
pause, and smile, and try to make it
out a burlesque or an irony. If he
says it in sport, we can understand
him, for Firmilian is out of sight a
more comprehensible person than his
prototype; but if our hero is in earnest,
we shake our perplexed heads
and let him go by—we know him
not. There may be such a person—far
be it from us to limit the creative
faculty; but how does anybody suppose
that we—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Creatures not too wise nor good</div>
      <div class='line'>For human nature’s daily food,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>can be able to comprehend a being
who makes no secret of his own intense
superiority, his elevation over
our heads? Again, we say, the
greater comprehends the less, and not
the less the greater. We can enter
into the trials and the delights of ordinary
men like ourselves; but, alas!
we are not able to enter into those pleasures
and poetic pains “which only
poets know.” And the poet knows
we cannot appreciate him—nay,
glories in our wonder as we gape after
him in his erratic progress—showers
upon us assurances that we cannot
understand, and laughs at our vain
fancy if we venture humbly to suppose
that we might; but in the name
of everything reasonable, we crave to
know, this being the case, why this
infatuated singer publishes his poem?
“Have you read my book?” says
Walter, in the <cite>Life Drama</cite>; and
being answered, “I have:” “It is
enough,” says the satisfied poet,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Book was only written for two souls,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they are thine and mine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Very well! So be it! We did not ask
Mr Smith for a poem, neither did
our importunity besiege the tower of
<cite>Balder</cite>; but if they were not written
for us, why tantalise us with these
mysterious revelations? For two
souls the <cite>Life Drama</cite> might have
answered exceeding well in manuscript,
and within the bounds of a
private circulation the exceptional
men who possibly could comprehend
him might have studied <cite>Balder</cite>. How
does it happen that Shakespeare’s wonderful
people, with all their great
individualities, are never exceptional
men? It is a singular evidence of
the vast and wide difference between
great genius and “poetic talent.” For
Shakespeare, you perceive, can afford
to let us all understand; thanks to
his commentators, there are a great
many obscure <em>phrases</em> in the Prince
of Poets—but all the commentators
in the world cannot make one character
unintelligible, or throw confusion
into a single scene.</p>

<p class='c009'><cite>Balder</cite>, we presume, has not yet
been hanged, indisputable as are his
claims to that apotheosis; for this is
only part the first, and our dangerous
hero has yet to progress through
sundry other “experiences,” and to
come at last “from a doubtful mind
to a faithful mind,”—how about his
conscience and the law, meanwhile,
Mr Dobell does not say. But we
have no objections to make to the
story of <cite>Balder</cite>. That such a being
should exist at all, or, existing, should,
of all places in the world, manage to
thrust himself into a poem, is the
head and front of the offending, to our
thought. The author of this poetic
Frankenstein mentions Haydon,
Keats, and David Scott as instances
of the “much-observed and well-recorded
characters of men,” in which
“the elements of his hero exist uncombined
and undeveloped.” Poor
Keats’s passionate poet-vanity seems
out of place beside the marvellous and
unexampled egotism of the two
painters; but we do not see how the
poet improves his position by this
reference; nay, had we demonstration
that Balder himself was a living
man, we do not see what better it
would be. He is a monster, were he
twenty people; and, worse than a
monster, he is a bore; and, worse
than a bore, he is an unbearable
prig! One longs to thrust the man
out of the window, as he sits mouthing
over his long-meditated epic,
and anticipating his empire of the
world. Yet it really is a satisfaction
to be told that this incarnate
vanity represents “the predominant
intellectual misfortune of the day.”
Is this then the Doubt of which Mr
Maurice is respectful, which Mr
Kingsley admires, and Isaac Taylor
lifts his lance to demolish? Alas,
poor gentlemen, how they are all deceived!
It is like the story we all
believed till truth-telling war found
out the difference for us, of the painted
ramparts and wooden bullets of the
Russian fortresses. If Mr Dobell is
right, we want no artillery against
the doubter—he will make few proselytes,
and we may safely leave him
to any elaborate processes he chooses
for the killing of himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many things go to the making of
all things,” says a quaint proverb—and
we require more than a shower
of similes, pelting upon us like the
<em>bonbons</em> of a carnival—more than a
peculiar measure, a characteristic
cadence, to make poetry. There is
our Transatlantic cousin rhyming
forth his chant to all the winds.
Well!—we thought we knew poetry
once upon a time—once in the former
days our heart leaped at sight
of a poetry-book, and the flutter of
the new white pages was a delight
to our soul. But alas, and alas! our
interest fails us as much for the <cite>Song
of Hiawatha</cite> as for the musings of
<cite>Balder</cite>; there is no getting through
the confused crowd of Mr Browning’s
<cite>Men and Women</cite>, and with reverential
awe we withdraw us from <cite>The
Mystic</cite>, not even daring a venturesome
glance upon that globe of darkness.
What are <em>we</em> to do with these
books? They suppose a state of leisure,
of ease, of quietness, unknown
to us for many a day. It pleases the
poet to sing of a distempered vanity
brooding by itself over fictitious misfortunes,
and what is it to us whether
a <cite>Maud</cite> or a <cite>Balder</cite> be the issue?—or
he treats of manners and customs,
names and civilisations, and what
care we whether it be an Indian
village or a May fair? We have
strayed by mistake into a delicate
manufactory—an <i><span lang="fr">atelier</span></i> of the <i><span lang="fr">beaux
arts</span></i>—and even while we look at the
workmen and admire the exquisite
manipulation of the precious toys before
us, our minds stray away out of
doors with a sigh of weariness to the
labours of this fighting world of ours
and the storms of our own life. There
is no charm here to hold us, none to
cheat us into a momentary forgetfulness
of either our languors or our labours.
If it is all poetry, it has lost
the first heritage and birthright of
the Muse: it speaks to the ear—it
does not speak to the heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet in this contention of cadences,
where every man’s ambition is for a
new rhythm, <cite>Hiawatha</cite> has a strong
claim upon the popular fancy. Possibly
it is not new; but if Mr Longfellow
is the first to make it popular,
it matters very little who invented
it; and to talk of plagiarism is absurd.
But, unhappily for the poet,
this is the very measure to attract
the parodist. <cite>Punch</cite> has opened the
assault, and we will not attempt to predict
how many gleeful voices may
echo his good-humoured mockery before
the year is out. The jingle of
this measure is irresistible, and with
a good vocabulary of any savage language
at one’s elbow, one feels a pleasing
confidence that the strain might
spin on for ever, and almost make itself.
But for all that, though the trick
of the weaving is admirable—though
we are roused into pleasant excitement
now and then by a hairbreadth
escape from a rhyme, and applaud the
dexterity with which this one peril is
evaded, we are sadly at a loss to find
any marks of a great or note-worthy
poem in this chant, which is fatally
“illustrative of” a certain kind
of life, but contains very little in itself
of any life at all. The greatest
works of art,—and we say it at
risk of repeating ourselves—are those
which appeal to the primitive emotions
of nature; and in gradual descent,
as you address the secondary and
less universal emotions, you fail in
interest, in influence, and in greatness.
<cite>Hiawatha</cite> contains a morsel of a love-story,
and a glimpse of a grief; but
these do not occupy more than a few
pages, and are by no means important
in the song. The consequence
is, of course, that we listen to it
entirely unmoved. It was not meant
to move us. The poet intends
only that we should admire him,
and be attracted by the novelty of his
subject; and so we <em>do</em> admire him—and
so we <em>are</em> amused by the novel
syllables—attracted by the chime of
the rhythm, and the quaint conventionalities
of the savage life. But we
cannot conceal from ourselves that it
<em>is</em> conventional, though it is savage;
and that in reality we see rather less
of the actual human life and nature
under the war-paint of the Indian
than is to be beheld every day under
the English broadcloth. The Muse is
absolute in her conditions; we cannot
restrain her actual footsteps;
from the highest ideal to the plainest
matter of fact there is no forbidden
ground to the wandering minstrel;
but it is the very secret of her individuality,
that wherever she goes she
sounds upon the chords of her especial
harp, the heart;—vibrations of
human feeling ring about her in
her wayfaring—the appeal of the
broken heart and the shout of the
glad one thrust in to the very pathway
where her loftiest abstraction
walks in profounder calm; and
though it may please her to amuse
herself among social vanities now and
then, we are always reminded of her
identity by a deeper touch, a sudden
glance aside into the soul of things—a
glimpse of that nature which makes
the whole world kin. It is this perpetual
returning, suddenly, involuntarily,
and almost unawares, to the
closest emotions of the human life,
which distinguishes among his fellows
the true poet. It is the charm
of his art that he startles us in an
instant, and when we least expected
it, out of mere admiration into tears;
but such an effect unfortunately can
never be produced by customs, or improvements,
or social reforms. The
greatest powers of the external world
are as inadequate to this as are the
vanities of a village; and even a
combination of both is a fruitless expedient.
No, Mr Longfellow has not
shot his arrow this time into the heart
of the oak—the dart has glanced
aside, and fallen idly among the
brushwood. His <cite>Song</cite> is a quaint
chant, a happy illustration of manners,
but it lacks all the important
elements which go to the making of
a poem. We are interested, pleased,
attracted, yet perfectly indifferent;
the measure haunts our ear, but not
the matter—and we care no more for
<cite>Hiawatha</cite>, and are still as little concerned
for the land of the Objibbeways,
as if America’s best minstrel had
never made a song. The poet was
more successful in the wistfulness of
his <cite>Evangeline</cite>, to which even these
lengthened, desolate, inquiring hexameters
lent a charm of appropriate
symphony; but it is a peculiarity of
this sweet singer that his best strains
are always <em>wistful</em>, longing, true
voices of the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is odd to remark the entire
family aspect and resemblance which
our English poets bear to one another.
Mr Tennyson is the eldest of
the group, and they all take after
him; but they are true brothers, and
have quite a family standard of merit
by which to judge themselves. Mr
Dobell is the sulky boy—Mr Browning
the boisterous one—Mr Smith
the younger brother, desperately bent
on being even with the firstborn, and
owning no claim of birthright. There
is but one sister in the melodious
household, and she is quite what the
one sister generally is in such a
family—not untouched by even the
schoolboy pranks of the surrounding
brothers—falling into their ways of
speaking—moved by their commotions—very
feminine, yet more acquainted
with masculine fancies than
with the common ways of women.
Another sister or two to share her
womanly moderatorship in this noisy
household might have made a considerable
difference in Mrs Browning:
but her position has a charm of its
own;—she never lags behind the fraternal
band, nay, sometimes stimulated
by a sudden impulse, glides on
first, and calls “the boys” to follow
her: nor does she quite refuse now
and then to join a wild expedition to
the woods or the sea-shore. If she
has sometimes a feminine perception
that the language of the brothers is
somewhat too rugged or too obscure
for common comprehension, she partly
adopts the same, with a graceful
feminine artifice, to show how, blended
with her sweeter words, this careless
diction can be musical after all;
and you feel quite confident that she
will stand up stoutly for all the brotherhood,
even when she does not
quite approve of their vagaries. She
has songs of her own, sweet and characteristic,
such as “Little Ellie,”
and leaps into the heart of a great
subject once in that <cite>Lay of the Children</cite>,
which everybody knows and
quotes, and which has just poetic exaggeration
sufficient to express the
vehement indignation with which the
song compelled the singer’s utterance.
Altogether, Mrs Browning’s poems,
rank them how you will in intellectual
power, have more of the native
mettle of poetry than most modern
verses. She is less artificial than her
brotherhood—and there is something
of the spring and freedom of things
<em>born</em> in her two earlier volumes;
she is not so assiduously busy over
the things which have to be made.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Robert Browning is the wild
boy of the household—the boisterous
noisy shouting voice which the elder
people shake their heads to hear. It
is very hard to make out what he
would be at with those marvellous
convolutions of words; but, after all,
he really seems to mean something,
which is a comfort in its way. Then
there is an unmistakable enjoyment
in this wild sport of his—<em>he</em> likes it,
though we are puzzled; and sometimes
he works like the old primitive
painters, with little command of his
tools, but something genuine in
his mind, which comes out in spite of
the stubborn brushes and pigments,
marvellous ugly, yet somehow true.
Only very few of his <cite>Men and Women</cite>
is it possible to make out: indeed, we
fear that the Andrea and the Bishop
Blougram are about the only intelligible
sketches, to our poor apprehension,
in the volumes; but there is a
pleasant glimmer of the author himself
through the rent and tortured
fabric of his poetry, which commends
him to a kindly judgment; and, unlike
those brothers of his who use the
dramatic form with an entire contravention
of its principles, this writer
of rugged verses has a dramatic
gift, the power of contrasting character,
and expressing its distinctions.</p>

<p class='c009'>But altogether, not to go further
into these characteristic differences,
they are a united and affectionate
family this band of poets, and chorus
each other with admirable amiability;
yet we confess, for poetry’s sake,
we are jealous of the Laureate’s indisputable
pre-eminence. It is not
well for any man—unless he chance
to be a man like Shakespeare, a happy
chance, which has never happened
but once in our race or country—to
have so great a monopoly; and it
is a sad misfortune for Tennyson
himself, that he has no one to try his
mettle, but is troubled with a shadowy
crowd of competitors eagerly
contending which shall reflect his
peculiarities best.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the manfuller voices are all
busy with serious prose or that craft
of novel-writing which is more manageable
for common uses than the
loftier vehicle of verse. True, there are
such names as Aytoun and Macaulay,
and we all know the ringing martial
ballad-notes which belong to these
distinguished writers; but Macaulay
and Aytoun have taken to other
courses, and strike the harp no
more. And while the higher places
stand vacant, the lower ones fill
with a crowd of choral people, who
only serve to show us the superiority
of the reigning family, such as
it is. It is a sad fact, yet we cannot
dispute it—poetry is fast becoming
an accomplishment, and the
number of people in “polite society”
who write verses is appalling. Only
the other day, two happy samples
of Young England came by chance
across our path—one a young clergyman,
high, high, unspeakably high,
riding upon the very rigging of the
highest roof of Anglican churchmanship,
bland, smooth, and gracious, a
bishop in the bud; the other, his antipodes
and perfect opposite, gone
far astray after the Warringtons and
Pendennises—a man of mirth and
daring, ready for everything. They
had but one feature of resemblance—an
odd illustration of what we have
just been saying. Both of them had
modestly ventured into print; both
of them were poets.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet that stream of smooth and
facile verse which surrounded us in
former days has suffered visible diminution.
It is a different kind of fare
which our minor minstrels shower
down upon that wonderful appetite of
youth, which doubtless cracks those
rough-husked nuts of words with delighted
eagerness, as we once drank
in the sugared milk-and-water of a
less pretending Helicon. After all, we
suspect it is the youthful people who
are the poets’ best audience. These
heirs of Time, coming leisurely to
their inheritance, have space for song
by the way; but in the din and
contest of life we want a more potent
influence. If the poet has anything
to say to us, he must even seize us
by the strong hand, and compel our
listening; for we are very unlike to
pause of our own will, or take time
to hear his music on any weaker argument
than this.</p>

<p class='c009'>And <em>he</em> too at last has gone away
to join his old long-departed contemporaries,
that old old man, with his
classic rose-garland, from the classic
table, where generations of men and
poets have come and gone, a world of
changing guests. He was not a great
poet certainly, and his festive, and
prosperous, and lengthened life called
for no particular exercise of our sympathies;
yet honour and gentle recollection
be with the last survivor of
the last race of Anakim, though he
himself was not among the giants.
The day has changed since that meridian
flush which left a certain splendour
of reflection upon Samuel Rogers,
the last of that great family of
song. Ours is only a twilight kind
of radiance, however much we may
make of it. It differs sadly from the
full unclouded shining of that Day of
the Poets which is past.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On arriving at our billet, we there
found the Padre, who expressed his
profound regrets at the insult offered
by the villagers to my companion,
and repeated his assurance that nothing
of the kind should happen
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Señor Padre,” said I, “that is
hardly sufficient. I think that people
who misconduct themselves as the
villagers have done, should be made
sensible of their error by stringent
measures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This time let it pass,” said M. le
Tisanier. “Should the same thing
happen again, I shall hold the alcalde
responsible, and shall invite
him” (M. le T. twists his mustache)
“to a promenade outside the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Padre was in a little bit of a
fidget. We had come upon him in
the kitchen, with a ladle on the stove,
and sleeves turned up. He was casting
bullets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No news of this French column,”
said he; “I have been waiting about
here, expecting intelligence all the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not send out some of the
villagers?” I asked. “They might
pick up information.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Señor Capitan,” he replied, “I
have thought of a better plan than
that. You and I were to have gone
out shooting to-day. Suppose we go
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With much pleasure,” said I,
“but what are we to effect by that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will take a new direction,”
he replied. “We will not go northwards,
as hitherto; we will go southwards.
This will bring us towards
the point from which the enemy are
approaching. We may obtain tidings;
perhaps we may get a sight of
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be guide, then,” I answered.
“Of course, you know the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trust me for that,” said he. “I
will not take you by the direct route
across the open plain. We will strike
off to the right, and skirt the foot of
the hills.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why go over rough ground, in
preference to level?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” said he, “you are, I perceive,
a novice in guerilla warfare.
Regular tactics are your line. If they
caught sight of us on the open plain,
don’t you see they would be sure to
overtake and capture us? If we have
the hills on our flank, cannot we at
any time escape up the rocks and
gullies? They are not likely to follow
us there. If they do, at any rate, I
promise you some beautiful shooting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let alone a little bloodletting
among the thorn-bushes,” said I;
“trousers in tatters, and our beasts
rolling heels over head down all sorts
of places.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must go on foot,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good,” said I; “you know
best. Only recollect my left leg is in
far better walking order for half-a-league
than for half-a-dozen. Suppose
I knock up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chito! then I will carry you on
my back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be it so,” said I, inwardly determining
to drop dead tired for the fun
of the thing, and take a spell out of
the Padre as long as I found it pleasant.
“Then, to-morrow after breakfast——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must start before breakfast,”
said the Padre.</p>

<p class='c009'>Supposing the enemy at hand, it
really was desirable to know what
they were about. So I ended by assenting,
with one proviso, to all the
Padre’s propositions. The proviso
was, that in the interval we received
no intelligence sufficiently conclusive
of itself, and rendering our reconnaissance
superfluous.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>No intelligence arrived, and early
next morning we set out to seek the
foe. M. le Tisanier was up betimes
to see us off. “Expect to see me return,”
said I, “in a state of absolute
exhaustion and immense inanition,
with heels hanging down over the
Padre’s shoulders. In pity have a
good dinner ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall be prepared for you,” said
M. le Tisanier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you feel easy,” said I
to the Padre as we went along, “respecting
the four Frenchmen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No fear about them,” replied the
Padre. “They know it is their
safety to keep quiet; and if they
come to any harm, it will be their
own act. If they attempt to move,
or even show themselves abroad, they
will be shot down <i><span lang="es">luego, luego</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our ramble proved well worth
taking for its own sake; but we saw
no Frenchmen, and very little game.
The Padre was fortunate, and bagged
a fox. My success was but scanty
in respect to hares and partridges.
After a long detour through a wild
and very thinly inhabited district,
and a few calls at scattered cottages
or rather hovels, the abode of a rough
and noble peasantry, all of whom
received the Padre with profound
veneration, and me as his companion
with high Spanish courtesy, we
reached at length a village which
we had agreed to make the extreme
limit of our excursion. Still obtaining
no intelligence, we set out, after
resting, on our return. We now,
however, took the direct route over the
plain, and found our journey homeward
far more agreeable than our journey
out. There was a point on which
I deemed it requisite to obtain information,
and the Padre being in a
remarkably conversable vein, the
present seemed a good opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mentioned,” said I, “that
the proprietors of your abode were
worthy people. I should be sorry,
for their sakes, if the house received
damage from the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “It is not altogether for their
sakes that I wish to preserve the
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Of course, not altogether.
Your own property—your own effects——”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “I have no property; I have
no effects; I have nothing. It is a
rule of my order. I am under a
vow of poverty. No, no; my
wish springs from a principle of
honour.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Just what I should feel towards
my own landlord. But you say it is
not on your landlord’s account.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “It is on account of the fraternity
of which I am an unworthy
member.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Oh, oh! then your fraternity
have an interest in the premises?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Not exactly in the building
itself, but in its contents. The fact
is, our convent——but I forget. You,
as a heret——pardon me; you, as an
Englishman, can have no acquaintance
with our regulations. I will
just explain. Our poor indigent
community has some trifling property
in lands, principally vineyards.
I am their factor. That house is
one of our depôts.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Very good wine, too, the
growth of your estates. Little did
I imagine, while seated with you at
table, or puffing a cigar, that we were
sipping the property of the Church.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “You may say smoking as
well as sipping. The cigars also are the
property of our humble fraternity.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Well, I like that idea of a vow
of poverty amazingly. You don’t intend
to convert me?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He</em> (benignantly). “One thing at
a time. As to the wine we drink,
you mistake, however, if you suppose
that is the wine we grow. The
wine grown on our lands is the <i><span lang="la">ordinario</span></i>
sort—abundant, indeed, as to
quantity, and in that respect valuable;
but not of a sort fit to be drunk
by my order. No, no; we exchange it
for better. For example, what you
have been drinking I trust you will
admit is a good sound wine.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “As good a Spanish red wine as
I ever tasted;”—and it was no compliment.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Yes, yes; and we sometimes
exchange for foreign wines. Would
that you had been here before the
branch convent, which is now your
hospital, was ransacked by the
French. Have I not good reason for
shooting a Frenchman whenever I
can? Ah, I would have given you
such a bottle of bordeaux! And
port! As good port as you can drink
in the Peninsula, and far better than
you ever are likely to drink in your
own country.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “And so it is you who have
the management of all this. Surely
it must give you no end of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Trouble? It is my business.
Besides that, it is a duty I owe my
fraternity, consequently a duty of
my profession. As to trouble, my
only real trouble is in running foreign
goods from the coast, or across the
frontiers. I certainly do sometimes
find a little trouble in that. But why
should I complain? After all, it is
exciting, and so far a pleasure. A
man of my cloth ought always to be
contented.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “French goods?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “French goods and English.
French, across the Pyrenees; English,
from the shores of the Mediterranean
and Bay of Biscay. We sell
again at a very fair profit—moderate
as becomes our order, but fair nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “A heavy deduction, though,
the fiscal exactions of your government,
no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiscal?” he exclaimed, frowning
horribly. “Fiscal? Do you think
me, in managing the concerns of my
venerable brotherhood, capable of
such a dereliction of principle—do
you consider me such an ass as to
permit any deduction like that?
Why, if we conducted our little business
subject to fiscal obstructions, we
might as well have no management
at all. Señor Capitan, although this
conversation was brought on by a remark
on your part, the subject is one
on which I have long wished to confer
with you confidentially, and I
thank you for the opportunity. And
now let me bespeak your kind, benevolent
offices on behalf of my self-denying
humble brethren. As I said
before, we profess poverty, we have
nothing. Charitable laics, touched
by our dependent and destitute condition,
have from time to time bequeathed
us trifles of landed property,
which we frugally farm to the
best advantage, taking the chance—you
know it is a toss-up—of profit or
loss. The produce, when realised,
we turn to account as well as our
poor opportunities permit; and my
object is to supplicate your best
offices in behalf of our little store in
the village, which, as well as one or
two others in different localities, is
under my charge and responsibility.
Some damage our store has suffered
already. After the plunder of the
convent by the French, your own
troops, on their arrival in the village,
found their way into the cellar of the
house, and were beginning to make
free with the wine, when you happily
arrived, and order was soon restored.
All I ask is, that as long as you remain
here, or have influence in this
neighbourhood, you will kindly give
our depôt the benefit of your protection,
so far as you may be able. I
ask it, not only on my own account,
but for the sake of my venerable
brethren. Our wants are few. The
French silks and English prints we
sell for what we can get. We also
drive a trifling business in English
cutlery, and French <i><span lang="fr">quincaillerie</span></i>.
The poor must do something to live.
As to the convent in Vittoria, I forward
to it from time to time, as best
I can, and when I have got them,
only little supplies of such common
necessaries as bordeaux, port, champagne,
sherry, French brandy when I
can get it good, sardines, gruyère
cheese, caviar, vermicelli, macaroni,
spicery, Dutch herrings, maraschino,
Hamburg sausages, and a few other
little knicknackeries not worth enumerating.
Our wants are few.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Had liberal Spain, when she laid
hands on the property of the religious
orders, gone through as she began,
made a clean work of it, and reformed
<span class='fss'>ALL</span> that we consider the errors
and abuses of Romanism, I, as an
ardent Protestant, should have cordially
rejoiced. But merely to confiscate
endowments, and to leave
other things as they are, is a different
thing. There can be no doubt of it,
that at the beginning of this century,
when Napoleon I. attempted to make
Spain a province of France, the Spanish
clergy, by their influence with the
nation, and by their success in maintaining
the spirit of national resistance,
were the saviours of their country.
That these have been made the
victims, and the only victims of reform,
is hard indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I walked on, listening to the
Padre’s discourse with so much interest,
that we arrived close upon our
village before I recollected his promise
of a lift, and my own fixed purpose of
taking it out of him. We were now
not a quarter of a mile from our
journey’s end; and I was beginning
to muse, with complacent anticipation,
on the capital dinner which
M. le Tisanier was to have ready on
our arrival, when we noticed Francisco
coming down the lane to meet
us.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he approached with hasty
strides, his visage was clouded. He
made an angry gesture, as if signalling
us to halt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That endiablado doctor,” said he,
“(may his soul never see the inside
of purgatory!) has armed the four
Frenchmen, seized all the ammunition
in the village, and barricaded
the house!”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>We halted. As the tidings brought
by Francisco deprived the Padre of
utterance, I demanded particulars.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appeared from Francisco’s indignant
statement that, subsequently
to our departure, when M. le Tisanier,
having made his preliminary arrangements
for our dinner, had visited the
hospitals, and was returning through
the village, he was again set upon by
the inhabitants. The villagers, taking
advantage of the Padre’s absence,
surrounded and insulted him, menaced
both him and the four prisoners with
death, and pelted him with stones,
one of which had taken effect, very
much to the detriment of his physiognomy.
On reaching home, however,
he occupied himself as usual, without
doing anything to excite suspicion;
but, after a while, he sent off Francisco
with a message to the “two
wounded Spaniards” at the convent,
and with directions to await their
further instructions. After being
detained a couple of hours, which he
spent in the study of English, under
the tuition of the convalescent soldiers,
with whom Francisco was
popular, the two Spaniards merely
gave him directions to go home
again, and he returned to the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>On entering the kitchen, he was
surprised to see what to all appearance
was a dinner ready-cooked,
arranged on a tray, and under covers.
M. le Tisanier, pointing to the tray,
bade him carry it to the Alcalde’s,
with a message that he himself would
be there immediately. The Alcalde
was from home; and Francisco, on
coming out after leaving the tray,
beheld in the street a spectacle which,
as he elegantly expressed himself,
“revolved his interior” (<i><span lang="es">revolvió-me
las tripas</span></i>). Close at hand appeared,
all bearing their muskets and fully
accoutred, the four French soldiers,
headed by M. le Tisanier, who
marched <i><span lang="fr">en militaire</span></i>, with his drawn
sword sloped on his shoulder. This
armed party, compelling him to return
with them, entered the Alcalde’s
house, demanded all the arms on the
premises, obtained a gun, a blunderbuss,
a pair of Spanish rapiers, and
a quantity of ammunition. They
then, leaving behind them a basket
which contained several bottles of
the Padre’s wine, went back to the
house, which immediately on their
entering they barricaded, leaving the
astonished Francisco in the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>The villagers noticed these proceedings
with consternation, but had
been taken by surprise, and were
overawed by the military display.
After the closing of the house, they
assembled tumultuously in the street,
and meditated all sorts of things.
But M. le Tisanier, appearing at the
window of an <i><span lang="es">entresuelo</span></i> (a closet or
small chamber half-way  up-stairs),
warned them to disperse if they did
not wish to be fired upon; an admonition
which they were the more
readily induced to follow by a bullet
that whistled over their heads.
They then withdrew to their huts,
anxiously watching the closed house,
in which no movement was discernible,
and expecting with much palpitation
the Padre’s return.</p>

<p class='c009'>Francisco, recovering from his first
surprise, had started off, he told us,
in search of the Padre and me; but
not knowing which way we had
taken, assuming that we had followed
our usual direction towards the
shooting-ground, and being too much
confused to make inquiries, he had
covered a great deal of ground to no
purpose, and had not got back to the
village till a short time before our
return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Santiago de Compostella!” gasped
the Padre, at length recovering
partially his senses and his breath,
and dashing his bonnet on the ground.
“For which of my many sins was I
withheld from cutting that hangdog’s
throat the first moment that I set
eyes on him! Santiago! <i><span lang="es">Trecientos
mil diablos!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Compose yourself, Señor Padre,”
said I. “At least wait till we see
how things look, and till we can
judge for ourselves. If the Doctor
has been menaced and assaulted,
what wonder that he should place
himself in security till our return?
The business, according to my view
of it, is not so serious as you appear
to think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said the Padre, wiping the
cold sweat from his forehead, “you
are very kind. I totally forgot what
I had just told you—that, with the
exception of the wine, I had sent off all
our stores to Vittoria.—Oh no! I
mistake! Three dozen Lamego
hams! Beautiful!—delicate! The
choicest rarity in these parts! Oh,
my Lamego hams! To think that
the poor provision for my self-denying,
self-mortifying, exemplary brethren
should go to feed those hounds
of Frenchmen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind,” I replied, still striving
to tranquillise his agitated feelings;
“should the worst come to the
worst, we’ll have them out of that
long before they finish your hams.
But not to lose time, suppose I just
step forward, and try the effects of a
parley.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On approaching the house, which
had now become a <i><span lang="fr">place d’armes</span></i>, I
saw no one stirring. Every shutter
was closed. It was a square low
building, as old as the Moors, flat-roofed,
solidly built of stone. Its
little windows were high above the
level of the ground. As I drew nigh,
I remarked that the large massive
door, which usually stood open all
day, was, as well as the shutters,
closed. Spanish-fashion, I took the
liberty of kicking at the said door, in
the absence of any such superfluities
as bell or knocker. A voice responded
over my head, “<i><span lang="fr">Quien es?</span></i>” (Who
is it?)</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked up. At the window
above, already indicated by Francisco’s
narrative, with an awfully damaged
peeper, stood M. le Tisanier.
He bowed politely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said he. “So you have
returned from your reconnaissance.
Any intelligence of the French
column? What sport to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not choosing to answer the former
of these inquiries, I addressed myself
to the latter. “Very poor indeed.
Only a brace and a half of birds, and
a couple of hares. The Padre, though,
has brought home a fox. Dinner
ready?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Your dinner? Oh, yes,
that was ready some hours ago. It
awaits you at the Alcalde’s—hope
you’ll enjoy it. It will merely require
warming.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Shall we not, then, have the
pleasure of your company?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “To tell you the truth, I have
made up my mind to remain where I
am. The villagers, as you perceive,
have maltreated me; so the idea
occurred to me, my best plan would
be to fortify the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “In our absence, quite right.
But now that the Padre has returned,
as well as myself, no further precaution
is requisite.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Pardon me. I take quite a
different view of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I</em> (a little annoyed). “Explain
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “In case you should receive
satisfactory intelligence that my
countrymen are approaching in force,
and supposing you should in consequence
deem it requisite to evacuate
this hamlet and fall back on Vittoria,
permit me to inquire, would you not
feel it your duty to invite me to accompany
you as a prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Probably.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Of course you would. Now,
that being your duty, I have been
led to consider what, under the circumstances,
is my duty. And it
strikes me, I confess, that in the prospect
of a speedy reunion with my
countrymen, the most proper thing I
can do is—to remain where I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Permit me, however, to suggest,
that if you persist in this view, and
if we should be induced in consequence
to adopt vigorous measures,
you may find yourself, on their proving
successful, very awkwardly situated
among the people of this place.
You know their feeling, and I might
no longer be able to restrain them.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Permit me, on the other
hand, to suggest, that should I maintain
myself in this house till my
countrymen arrive, the exploit will
cover me with glory, my comrades
will rush to congratulate me, and I
shall be appreciated throughout the
French army. In short, M. le Capitaine,
I consider my actual position impregnable;
and never in my life did I
feel more completely at my ease than
I do at this moment. Benevolently
anxious to prevent the needless effusion
of blood, I tender you my disinterested
advice to abstain from any rash
attempt; and, by no means unwilling
to impart useful information, I beg to
state that, while your sick men in the
hospital have next to no ammunition,
I, on my part, have secured all
the powder and shot in the village.
The Padre’s store, the Alcalde’s, and—pardon
me—your own, are all in
my safe keeping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Beginning to feel out of temper, I
made an appeal. “I thought, Monsieur,
in dealing with an officer and
a gentleman, I should, at any rate, find
security in his plighted word. Remember,
you are on your parole.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” he replied with much gravity,
“you touch my honour. I cannot
permit that. But, Monsieur, I think
you scarcely recollect. My parole?
Let me see. What was my parole?
That I would not escape from this
place. Very good. Here I am. If
my own countrymen come and fetch
me away, that, of course, is quite
another affair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was sick of this long conversation,
and a little sulky. “Monsieur,”
said I, “you seem to reckon on the
arrival of your countrymen. Doubtless
the movement on their part will
bring some of mine. Should you hold
out till they arrive, which, however,
is far from certain, depend upon it
you will not again obtain your parole;
you will be treated as a common
prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind,” said he; “I must
take the rough with the smooth. As
far as my own military experience
goes, the French are quite as quick in
their movements as the English; and
you yourself have taught me to believe”
(he bows very low indeed)
“that the conduct of British officers
to a French officer who happens to
find himself in their power, will
never be other than that of a gentleman.
By the by, I have a little request
to make. Should you send for
assistance to Vittoria, pray let it be
such a force that I may capitulate
without disgrace,—not less than a
<i><span lang="fr">corps d’armée</span></i>, I beg. As to artillery,
a siege-train, if you please. I could
not possibly surrender to field guns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt excessively disgusted, and
was about to withdraw. Yet, recollecting
that, with all his gasconade,
M. le Tisanier had certainly manifested
a sort of good feeling, by preparing
our dinner in the midst of his arrangements
for defence, I paused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry our stock of game is
so small to-day,” said I. “Will you
do me the favour to accept of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said he, with an air of
decision; “I could not. Excuse me.
A thousand thanks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come,” said I; “bent as
you are on resistance, at least let us
carry on this war without mutual
animosity. Oblige me by accepting
of the hares and partridges for your
private use.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is out of the question,” he
answered firmly.  “Honour forbids
my compliance. Nevertheless,” he
added, after a pause, as if struck by
some new idea, “to prove that I am
not above receiving an obligation, I
will accept—the fox.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accept the fox? Though not exactly
understanding this, I returned
to where I had left the produce of the
day’s sport in the keeping of the
Padre and Francisco. The Padre
was gone; so, making free to lift the
fox from Francisco’s shoulders, I went
back to the place of conference, and
handed it up to M. le Tisanier, who
reappeared at his window. He received
the gift without explanation,
but with a profusion of bows as
well as many polite acknowledgments.
Fortunate for him were his limber indications
of gratitude; for, just as
he made his first bow on receiving
the slaughtered fox, the crack of a
musket from an opposite hovel was
accompanied by the whiz of a bullet,
which passed just over his head, and,
had he remained upright, would have
doubtless passed through it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said he; “another bullet
added to our store of ammunition,
and one charge less in the Padre’s
pouch. That was his musket.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said I, “be persuaded. Go
in at once. The Padre will not
make a second miss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will take at least two minutes,”
he replied, “ere the Padre can fire
again. Monsieur,” he continued, with
earnestness and emotion, “I have yet
a request. Having resolved to assume
my present attitude of defensive hostilities,
not so much for my own sake,
as to save my captive countrymen, to
whom even your influence might not
always prove an adequate protection
in this execrable village, I think you
can guess the parties who are now
the chief objects of my solicitude. On
the whole, I judged it their safest
course that they should continue in
the hospital rather than join me
here. As Spaniards, should they find
their present position untenable, they
can at any rate escape. But, as you
know my secret, may I still depend
on your good offices? May I venture
to hope that, in any case of exigency,
you will render all the assistance in
your power to one whose life I prize,
as much as—as much as I disregard
my own?” There spoke the Gascon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Depend upon me,” I replied.
“Now withdraw from the window
without further parley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He backed into the house with
another bow, and reclosed the shutter.
As he disappeared he smiled;
nor could I altogether preserve my
gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certainly the Padre’s ideas touching
the laws of war were a little
primitive. In fact, his firing while
the conference was in progress, looked
almost like violating a flag of truce.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Señor Padre,” said I, on
entering the cottage whence the shot
had proceeded, “how do you intend
to regain possession of your
house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Padre looked dumfounded.
“I rather depended on your experience,”
he replied. “Were I in the
house, I would undertake to hold it
against fifty Frenchmen. But, as we
must now be the assailants, and as that
is a line of warfare less in my way, I
look chiefly to your own more extensive
acquaintance with sap, mining,
intrenchments, and approaches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” I answered. “You
have thought fit to commence operations,
so you must go through with
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Señor Capitan,” said the Padre,
“I am already sufficiently punished
by having missed that shot. Do not
aggravate my penalty by——.” Enter
a messenger in haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Francisco, not only in haste,
but in a high state of exasperation.
His look I will not attempt to delineate.
The face of a well-conducted,
taciturn, sober-minded Spaniard, when
distorted by passion, must be seen,
not described; and, if seen, will not
soon be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The enemy,” he cried, “defies us!
He has hoisted his standard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>We looked towards the house. An
ensign of some sort he had raised,
sure enough; of what kind we could
not immediately distinguish, but the
fact was palpable. From the flat
roof there rose a slender pole, and
at its summit hung suspended and
swinging in the wind a something—what?—the
fox’s brush.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Francisco spoke truly. It was defiance,
and no mistake. To hang out
a fox’s tail! Not only defiance, but
mockery—rank insult! I had suggested
to M. le Tisanier, in our recent parley,
the possible arrival of an English force.
But this was a contingency to be
now as much deprecated on my part
as on his. To be caught by my
countrymen laying siege to my own
prisoner ensconced in my own billet,
the housetop surmounted by a banner
which whimsically spoke the language
of challenge and derision combined,—why,
on returning to headquarters,
I should never hear the end
of it. M. le Tisanier might think it
a very good joke; but I very soon
settled it in my own mind that either
by storm or by regular approach I must
reduce him and his garrison in the
least possible time. So nothing remained
but to let slip the dogs of
war—<em>i. e.</em>, to open the campaign.</p>

<p class='c009'>From inquiries instituted on my suggestion
by the Padre, it was at once
ascertained that the village possessed
next to nothing in the shape of ammunition
and <em>matériel</em> for carrying on
the siege. M. le Tisanier had indeed
very correctly stated that the bulk
was in his own safe keeping. Burning
the house would not exactly have
suited the Padre, even had it been
built of combustible materials, or had
I myself entertained any such truculent
designs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without interruption on the part
of the enemy, I reconnoitred the
building on all sides. It stood in its
strength, completely detached from all
other tenements, without garden,
trees, fences, or anything else affording
cover for our approaches. Close
by, indeed, there stood a small shed
which served as a wood-house, solidly
built of stone. But this also was
entirely detached from the main
building; and its door, opening sideways,
was completely commanded
from the roof and windows of the
house itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having posted some of the villagers
to watch in the surrounding cottages,
with directions to report if they noticed
any movement in the house, but not to
show themselves, the Padre and I, not
in the best of humours, were about to
withdraw to our dinner at the Alcalde’s.
At that moment, with some
surprise, I noticed Sergeant Pegden
coming down the village from the
hospital.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sergeant Pegden was a Dover man.
On my visit to the hospital the day
before, I had left him, tardily convalescent,
in bed. His conduct in the
regiment had been always good, and
had gained his actual rank as a noncommissioned
officer. Like many
other fine fellows, he had knocked
up in the Vittoria campaign; and,
after going into hospital, he had appeared
to be labouring under a total
prostration of physical powers, almost
amounting to atrophy. He there was
kept as comfortable as circumstances
permitted, and had perfect rest. But
even with all the benefit of M. le
Tisanier’s culinary skill, he had made
but poor progress; in fact, his frame
appeared too far exhausted to recruit,
except very gradually indeed, by either
rest or nourishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sergeant’s step, as he now approached,
was shaky, almost tottering.
His countenance, emaciated while he
remained in bed, now looked deathlike.
He had turned out neat and
tidy after a fashion, though his clothing
was worn and faded. He reached
us, and we exchanged salutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Pegden,” said I, “what
brings you down here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please—sir,” he feebly replied, “I
hope you’ll excuse me; but we heard
what has happened, so I thought I
had better come down. Would have
been here a good bit sooner, sir, only
if I hadn’t not had some stitching to
do first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What other men,” I asked, “are
able to turn out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, sir,” replied he, “that’s
what they wished me to speak to you
about. There’s five of them as says
they can come down whenever you
please, sir, only if they had a few buttons,
and some needles and thread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which five are they?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the Lancashire man, sir,”
he answered, “and there’s Sandwich
Sam, and Cockney, and the Parson,
them four. And there’s Teakettle
Tom, he says he thinks he could come,
only he hasn’t not got no breeches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good,” said I; “go into the
house, and take some refreshment,
while we see what the village can
supply. To-morrow morning you can
bring the men down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Padre having instituted an inquiry
in the village to meet the requisition
for military stores, we sat
down to dinner. All the articles required
were soon forthcoming; so,
having allowed the Sergeant a little
time for rest and refreshment, I directed
Francisco to take the things,
and to go back with the Sergeant to
the convent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner concluded, we were leaving
the house, when I was surprised to
find Sergeant Pegden seated in the
porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Sergeant,” said I, “will
you take anything more to eat or to
drink? I fear you have overtaxed
your strength.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing more, thank’e, sir,” said
the Sergeant. “Much obliged to
you for all favours. Only please, sir,
I’m waiting for that Sandwich Sam.
I brought him down with me from
the hospital; only when we got into
the village he hung behind, because
he said he wasn’t regimental.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said I, “bring him down
in the morning with the rest, as tidy
as you can turn them out. When you
get back to the hospital, you will probably
find he is there before you.
By the by, Pegden, I suppose you
know all about those two Spaniards
up there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sergeant sniggered. “Yes,
sir,” said he; “we all knows pretty
well about them.” The smirk on the
Sergeant’s cadaverous visage reminded
one of a death’s-head illumined
by a flash of lightning. In fact, it
might be truly said that the Sergeant
“grinned horribly a ghastly smile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well then,” I added, “tell the
men I depend on their good behaviour.
There must be no annoyance,
no interference of any kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I had by this time mentally arranged
my plan of operations for the next day.
So, after posting a relief of sentinels,
I lay down in my clothes, occasionally
going my rounds till daybreak, to keep
the watchmen wide awake, and secure
a good look-out. What I chiefly apprehended
was an attempt of the garrison
to escape in the night.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Early in the morning, Sergeant
Pegden brought down his party;
one short, however, of the number
announced by him the evening before.
The absent man was Sam, the
same who had been already reported
missing. In fact, I learnt from the
Sergeant that Sam had been out all
night, and had not returned to the
convent at all. This was a serious
reduction of our available force.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sandwich Sam, <em>alias</em> “Shrimps,”
had, previous to his enlistment, enjoyed
the benefit of a somewhat
amphibious education. By profession
a hoyman, but also smart as a
smuggler, he had occasionally condescended
to fill up a leisure hour
with the lively amusement of shrimping.
Though certainly not the steadiest
man in the regiment, Sam, who was a
very handy fellow, and an old campaigner,
when sober knew his duty,
and maintained, on the whole, the
character of a smart soldier.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under other circumstances, I should
have given directions for looking him
up. But the sick Sergeant, and his
party of convalescents, had, in their
zeal for his majesty’s service, come
down without their breakfast. I
therefore felt it my more immediate
duty, as the best preparation for the
exploits of the day, to supply them
with that needful meal. My brave
army had turned out anything but
stout in health and smart in equipment;
but they all showed full of
pluck, well under command, and
ready for anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having extemporised a breakfast
for the men, the Padre and I sat
down to our own. Touching the
important operations of the day, we
were proceeding with our arrangements
when an interruption took
place, in the shape of a little disturbance
outside. Sergeant Pegden
was speaking to some one in the
street, and speaking loud, in a voice
of authority and angry expostulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come now, you; be quiet. Fall
in, and behave like a man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A voice responded: “File up your
rusty old keys! Lock up your chastises!
and go to dinner with the poor!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better take care, Sam,” growled
Teakettle Tom in a low voice. “The
Captain’s in there, a-having his breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, is he?” replied Sam, “then
I’ll give him a song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My fairther, he’s a preacher,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A wherry honest man;</div>
      <div class='line'>My mother, she’s a washy-wom’;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I’m a true Brit-tan,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>With my whack fol lol,’” &#38;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I send Francisco to call in Sergeant
Pegden. Enter the Sergeant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Pegden,” said I, “what’s
all this about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very sorry, sir,” replied the Sergeant;
“but I’m afraid Sandwich
Sam is a little overtaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can that be?” I asked.
“Where could he get it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, sir, I don’t know,” said
the Sergeant. “But he seems to
have got too much of it, and he has
some with him now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring him in,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>Glorious, but a little stupid, Sam
was brought in. His hand grasped
the neck of a half-emptied bottle.
Under his arm was another bottle,
corked and full.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see what’s the matter,” said the
Padre. “The man has found his way
into the store-closet, and got at the
wine which was brought here yesterday.
Francisco, how could you be so
negligent? Step into the back-room,
and see whether he has left us any.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Francisco went as directed, and
promptly returned. “Not a bottle
is missing,” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Señor Capitan,” said the Padre,
“this is an enigma. With the exception
of my stock, there is no bottled
wine in the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To make sure, suppose we try it,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No need of that,” answered the
Padre. “The villagers keep their
wine in skins. The Alcalde keeps
his in a barrel. Within a circuit of
three or four leagues, my cellar, since
our convent here was plundered, is
the only depôt of bottled wine. My
reason for keeping a stock you will
readily understand. My poor self-denying
fraternity, when they <em>do</em> drink
wine, prefer it from the bottle, not
from the wood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why then, according to that,” said
I, “this drunken fellow must, since
last night, have found his way into
the cellar of the house which we are
presently to attack and carry by
storm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can only repeat what I have
said already,” replied the Padre. “It
is an enigma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where have you been, Sam?”
I asked. “What have you been
about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About?” hiccupped Sam. “What
have you been about? I am the lad
as can (<em>hiccup</em>) show the British
(<em>hiccup</em>) army how to walk into (<em>hiccup</em>)
the hinnimy’s persition, and (<em>hiccup</em>)—Oh,
my dear Sergeant Pegden,
I vos so wherry dry (<em>hiccup</em>)—knocked
off the heads of half-a-dozen (<em>hiccup</em>)—and
didn’t not drink owny hate on
’em (<em>hiccup</em>.) Hooray! Death or
glo——(<em>hiccup, hiccup</em>).” Here Sam
became so much worse, that I felt it
advisable to order his immediate removal
from the apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was no bad way of assailing
the hostile fortress, if we could effect
a lodgment in its lowest storeys.
Assuming that Sam had been there
before us, the first question was how
he entered; but this he was too far
gone to tell us.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It was imperative, however, to determine
the question without loss of
time, and to determine it without
revealing the fact to the garrison, to
whom, it was to be presumed, their
weak point remained as yet a secret.
Under these circumstances, having
first directed Francisco to ascertain
as far as possible, in the village, what
Sam had been about the night before,
I promptly commenced a general reconnaissance
of the enemy’s position.
The affair, which had hitherto been
stupid enough, now became a little
exciting. I made the circuit of the
beleaguered house without interruption
from the foe, but also without
discovering an entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>My attention, however, was at
length attracted by the wood-house,
which stood by the side of the premises,
contiguous, but wholly detached
from them. At that end of the shed
which was farthest removed from the
main building, I noticed, close to the
gable-wall, what appeared to be a
small heap of rubbish. To this, without
betraying my object, I could not
make a direct approach; yet it
seemed to invite further investigation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It soon became apparent, on more
particularly noting the character of
the locality, that, by availing himself
of the shelter afforded by one or two
neighbouring cottages, a person might
approach obliquely, without being
noticed from the dwelling itself, right
up to the end wall of the wood-house,
where the rubbish was lying on the
ground. Immediately availing myself
of this important discovery, I
made my approaches accordingly, and
reached the spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>The heap of rubbish was at once
accounted for. A hole had been broken
in the wall. The opening was sufficiently
large, so I took the liberty
of entering, and now found myself in
the wood-house, which was decidedly
an outwork of the enemy’s position.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sam had been there before me, and
had left his marks in the shape of
empty bottles. But, what was still
more important to the progress of the
siege, I noticed, at the other end of
the shed, which was furthest from
the perforated wall, and nearest to
the house, an excavation in the
earthen floor. I looked down, but
could not discover its depth. Nothing
could be discovered, save darkness
visible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here then was the shaft by which
Sam had walked into the Padre’s best
bin; and here too, in all probability,
was a ready-made entrance into the
enemy’s stronghold. Determining to
muster my forces and head an assault
without further loss of time, I quitted
the outhouse, as I had entered it,
without being observed, and returned
to the Alcalde’s. The Padre, at my
request, followed me into a private
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Señor Padre,” said I, “oblige me
by describing in general terms the
topography of your cellar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, <i><span lang="es">hijo mio</span></i>,” said the Padre
with deep emotion, “I trust you have
no idea of carrying on the war in that
quarter. Believe me, except the Lamego
hams, the cellar contains nothing
but wine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me,” I asked, “does your
cellar extend under ground in a lateral
direction? Has it any subterranean
recesses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, believe me,” replied the
Padre in a panic, “with the sole exception
of the wine and the hams, and
a few trifling articles in silver which
I succeeded in rescuing from our
plundered convent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you wish,” I replied, “to be
reinstated forthwith in the possession
of your cellar, and of your house besides,
only have the goodness to
explain to me——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, spare the cellar!” cried the
Padre, frightened out of his wits,
“even if a dozen houses—all the
houses in the village—are assaulted,
sacked, gutted, levelled with the
ground, blown up sky-high!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the use of talking in that
way?” I replied. “Come, Señor
Padre, just give me the information
I want, and it shall go hard with us
but you and I will dine in the house
this afternoon. We must take it offhand,
and I already discern the road
to victory. Only tell me, does the
cellar extend, underground, outside
the walls of the house? In particular,
does it extend in the direction of
the adjoining shed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Padre subsided into a brown
study. “Why, now you ask the
question,” said he, “I think it does.
The house is old, built after the
fashion of the Moors. There certainly
is an underground recess or passage,
of some length, going off from the
cellar; and, on consideration, I think
it must run in the direction of the
wood-house—nay, perhaps extend under
it. Probably it served originally
as a subterranean communication between
the outhouse and the house
itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The “enigma” was now well-nigh
solved. I summoned Francisco, and
inquired whether he had succeeded
in obtaining from the villagers any
intelligence of Sam’s proceedings.
All that could be learnt amounted to
this, which, however, was quite decisive:
that Sam, the night before,
when he stole away from Sergeant
Pegden, went begging from cottage
to cottage, till he had procured the
loan of an implement called a “pico,”
which, though not identical with an
English pickaxe, in some measure
resembles it, and is available for the
same purposes. Sam, having made
this acquisition, was seen no more,
till he reappeared in the village next
morning, “mucho embriagado” (very
drunk).</p>

<p class='c009'>I also recollected that when, on
our first occupation of the village,
some little plundering took place, Sam,
though he had pleaded exemption
from duty as an invalid, and had been
brought along on a bullock-car, then
also contrived to become considerably
elevated; and I now felt convinced
that he had made his first acquaintance
with the Padre’s cellar on that
occasion. The rest was easily explained.
An old smuggler, accustomed,
in the locality of his former
exploits, Kingsdown, Walmer, Richborough,
&#38;c., to underground deposits
of goods, he had, in his previous visit
to the Padre’s bins, at once made
himself acquainted with the peculiarities
of the position; and now, on
his return to the village with the
Sergeant, he had promptly embraced
this first opportunity of renewing his
acquaintance with such an agreeable
locality. Hence the requisition for
the pickaxe, the hole in the wall, the
excavation in the floor. Sam, it was
clear, had tapped the Padre’s cellar
before he tapped his wine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking a circuitous route in order
that the enemy might not discover
our movements, I brought round the
Sergeant and three of the men to the
perforated wall. We then passed
through the opening, one by one,
and got into the wood-house unseen
by the garrison. Hurra! we
have effected a lodgment in the
enemy’s counterscarp—only don’t
make a noise.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The shaft by which Sandwich Sam
had dropped into the Padre’s cellar
could not be very deep, but we saw
no bottom. It struck me that something
might be gained by excluding
the daylight, which principally entered
by the newly-made hole in the
gable-end of the shed. Against this
hole, therefore, I placed the three
soldiers, to keep out as much light as
possible; and now the Sergeant and
I, on looking down into the shaft,
were able to discern a glimmer which,
feeble as it was, sufficed to show us
that, assisted by others, a person
might descend with no great difficulty.
I, therefore, descended first; the
Sergeant followed; then came the
men.</p>

<p class='c009'>We found ourselves in an arched
tunnel constructed of stone, and leading
from under the outhouse, with
which in former days it had doubtless
communicated, right into the
cellar, which we entered—cautiously,
you may suppose, but without difficulty.
Now, M. le Tisanier! Once in
the cellar, we no longer had need
to grope our way. There was no
window, but light came in from various
crannies. I listened. There were
footsteps above. So! we were under
the kitchen. How effect an entrance?</p>

<p class='c009'>Close to the wall of the cellar, and
immediately to the left of the opening
by which we had entered from
the recess, stood a dilapidated flight
of steps, say an old ladder. Doubtless
there was a trap-door at its summit.
I mounted, and gently pressed
against the ceiling above. It gave
signs of yielding. The way into the
fortress, then, lay open before us.
Turning to Sergeant Pegden, I desired
him in a whisper to remain with the
three soldiers where he was, but to
hold them in readiness to come forth
on my first summons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, using a little more force, I
gradually raised the trap-door, which
was kind enough not to creak, and
emerged into the kitchen. There
stood M. le Tisanier, <em>solus</em>. Profoundly
intent on some culinary operation,
which with his accustomed
sedulity he was conducting at the
stove, he awhile remained utterly
unconscious of my presence. I let
down the trap-door into its frame,
and so concealed the manner of my
entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>From scanty materials he was preparing
dinner for the garrison. On
a dresser I noticed—1, A very moderate
supply of bread for a party of
five; 2, Some lard; 3, Certain wild
herbs, roots, and champignons, such
as he had been accustomed to cull in
his rambles; 4, The bones remaining
from former meals, specially those of
a hare, a goose, and a hind quarter
of mutton; 5, The giblets of the
said goose, set apart with the head
and pluck of the said hare, as if
designed for some signal triumph of
a scanty cuisine. I coughed. He
turned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Startled at first, he recovered in an
instant his usual self-possession and
urbanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” said he, “good morning, M.
le Capitaine. I am not at present
exactly aware how you found your
way in, but I am not the less happy
to see you. In entering without noise
you have acted wisely. Considering
the state of things outside, you could
not have adopted a more discreet or
a safer mode of presenting yourself
before me, with the view of surrendering
yourself a prisoner. Good.
You will do me the honour of dining
with me. Thus will you escape the
inconvenience of losing, even for a
single day, the benefit of my matchless
skill as a culinary amateur.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you are preparing dinner,”
said I, “without having availed yourself
of the Padre’s stores.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah!” he exclaimed; “cookery,
in its higher operations, is independent
of materials. When there is nothing
for dinner, then it is that the true
artist develops his professional resources.
To tell you the truth, Monsieur,
the Padre’s chief store is his
cellar, into which he never permitted
me to enter. I therefore, with that
delicacy which always distinguishes
men of elevated sentiments like myself,
felt it right, now that I am in
military possession, to abstain from
purveying in that direction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was all the better for the
Padre’s Lamego hams, and also the
enterprise by which we had effected
a lodgment. For, had M. le Tisanier
once made acquaintance with the
cellar, he was not the man to
have left that way of approach
unguarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it,” I asked, “that your
garrison keeps so bad a look-out?
Here am I, come to beat up your
quarters, without having received a
single challenge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pooh, pooh,” he replied; “no
doubt they let you in on purpose.
As you have presented yourself here
without showing a flag of truce, of
course I must regard you as my
prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me,” said I, “if I take
the opposite view. Monsieur, you
are my prisoner. Probably you are
not aware that my forces have effected
a lodgment, and at this moment occupy
your position.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it possible?” he exclaimed seriously,
setting down a saucepan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Monsieur,” I replied, “I give you
my word that the soldiers under my
command now occupy these premises
in force. And by the same entrance
through which they came in, I could,
if I pleased, bring in not only my
reserve, but all the Spaniards in the
village. You know what would be
the consequences. Yesterday you expressed
a benevolent wish to prevent
the needless effusion of blood. Now,
therefore, give me credit for being
actuated on my part by a similar
motive of humanity, in politely soliciting
your instant surrender. In case
of further resistance on your part,
although I can control my own men,
I could not answer for the Padre and
his people, who are very much exasperated.
Therefore determine what
you will do; but, remember, your
own life, and the lives of your unfortunate
and gallant countrymen, depend
on your decision.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Have the kindness to put it
on their lives only, not on mine.
Then I can treat without compromising
my sense of honour. By further
resistance, you say, their lives
would be imperilled. In case of my
condescending to accept terms of
capitulation, would their lives be
safe?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “That I have already arranged
with the Padre. He promises, in
case of your coming to terms without
delay, to be answerable for the personal
security of your whole party
till you are safe in the hands of the
English at Vittoria. He also promises
that he will remain in the village as
a check on his own countrymen till
the transfer takes place.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “It appears then that, by accepting
terms, I may now secure that
safety for my comrades which I
sought by resistance. Very well, M.
le Capitaine. In occupying and holding
this position, I discharged a duty.
In surrendering it, I discharge another.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Very good. Then all is settled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me,” said M. le Tisanier,
assuming an air of considerable gravity.
“There is one little matter
which we have not settled yet.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“It will gratify me to meet your
wishes,” said I, “in any further arrangement
which you may propose.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “M. le Capitaine, you particularly
oblige me by saying so; for
the business to which I now refer is
one which personally affects you and
me. In the conference which I had
the pleasure of holding with you
yesterday afternoon, you alluded to
my parole in terms which affected
my honour. As I said then, so I say
now: I cannot permit that.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Nothing could be further from
my intention. Surely, in merely reminding
you of your parole, not saying
you had broken it, and in viewing
it according to my own interpretation
rather than yours, I did nothing at
which you can reasonably feel hurt.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Ha! you explain, but you
do not apologise. M. le Capitaine,
though punctilious—nay, more than
punctilious, chivalrous—I am not
implacable. One word of apology
would——”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Apology? What do you mean
by apology? I tell you I intended
no offence; and I have nothing to
retract. If I unintentionally wounded
your feelings, of course I regret it;
but apology is out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Precisely. That is just what
I expected you to say. Then, M. le
Capitaine, there remains but one alternative.
We had better decide this
little affair at once. (<em>Brings from a
corner of the kitchen two swords.</em>)
You really must oblige me.” (<em>Crosses
the swords in his right hand, bows,
and presents the hilts.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “If you insist upon it, of course
I must. I never heard of anything
so absurd in my life!”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Hold! Let me fasten the
kitchen-door. That will prevent interruption
on the part of my countrymen,
and also of yours.” (<em>He fastens
the door.</em>)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “The door may serve to exclude
your men, but it will not keep
out mine. No matter. They have
already received orders to keep where
they are, till summoned by me.” We
crossed our swords.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Hold! Excuse me one moment,
just while I take off that
boiler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again our swords crossed.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Monsieur, the attack is with
you.” (<em>Stamps.</em>) “<i><span lang="fr">Commencez donc.</span></i>”
(<em>Stamps twice.</em>) “Not bad, that
lunge. Hold! your left shoulder is
a little too forward. Withdraw it
<i><span lang="fr">un petit peu</span></i>, if you please. Capital,
that thrust in quarte! You lunge
better in quarte than in tierce. I
hope you enjoyed your dinner yesterday?
Ah, you threw away that
<em>coup</em>. By keeping your point a
trifle lower, you might have had me
just under the arm. I suppose the
Padre was not in the best of humours?
You fence a little too wide.
Better! Capital! Capital!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though acknowledged the best
fencer in my regiment, I could make
no impression on M. le Tisanier. I
therefore bowed, and stood on my
guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” said he, “now the attack is
with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The attack of M. le Tisanier was
not only brilliant and energetic, but
in every respect formidable. With
the arm of a Hercules, the eye of a
lynx, and the skip of a chimpanzee,
he advanced, he retreated, he sidled
right and left, he got round me, till
we had more than once perambulated
the whole circuit of the kitchen, and
till I, in meeting him front to front,
had repeatedly faced the opposite
points of the compass. Any one
practised in fence will understand,
when I say that, even while I succeeded
in parrying every thrust, his
attack was evidently <em>gaining</em> upon
me; that is, his movements in assault
had become a little in advance
of mine in guard; and this advantage
(most important, though in
point of time scarcely appreciable)
he gradually went on improving as
the attack proceeded. In fact, nothing
could be cleaner than his style
of operating. Even his wrist, though
always in position, moved in a larger
area than his point, which played
about my sword in a small semicircle,
like summer lightning.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length, seeing an opportunity
for which I had long watched, I
raised my blade by the same movement
with which I parried a thrust
in quarte, and, ere he could recover
himself, dropped it again so as just
to touch his hand. My object was
to inflict a slight wound, and disarm
him. I was so far successful, that
my point reached him, but with no
visible consequences. I had made
the first hit, but without putting my
opponent <i><span lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sprang backwards with an
angry growl, and for a few moments
seemed to be collecting his forces.
Foreseeing the impetuosity of his
renewed assault, I prepared to give
him a suitable reception; but, at the
instant when about to commence a
repetition of his favours, he moved a
little to the right. This movement
compelled on my part a corresponding
change of position, to effect which
I slightly shifted my left foot. My
foot struck against something on the
floor. I stumbled. Though just on
the point of springing forward, M. le
Tisanier, who through this mishap
had me completely at his mercy,
with a most winning bow immediately
dropped his point.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cause of my tripping is easily
explained. Sergeant Pegden, either
from having discovered, down in the
cellar, that war had commenced over
his head, or from some other motive,
was beginning to raise the trap-door.
I tripped against the edge. Stamping
it down with my left heel, as a
sign for the sergeant to keep quiet,
but not so as to attract the notice of
M. le Tisanier, who remained unconscious
that my forces were in such
immediate proximity, I again put
myself on guard, saying, “My best
acknowledgments are due for your
forbearance. Whenever you wish to
proceed, I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A thousand thanks,” said M. le
Tisanier, with a renewal of supple
and profound inflections. “I am
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” said I, extending my
hand. “All things besides, then,
can be easily arranged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We tackled after the English fashion,
and shook hands—an operation
the more sedulously sought on
my part, from visible symptoms of
preparation, on the part of M. le
Tisanier, for what in those days so
frequently terminated French duels—a
hug.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shake accomplished, I noticed
something on my hand. It was
blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this yours, or mine?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I not tell you that I was
satisfied?” said he. “My honour is
satisfied. Whether I am whipped
through the body, or scratched on
the knuckle, what does it signify?”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII., AND LAST.</h3>

<p class='c013'>From the inferior regions now rose
the voice of Sergeant Pegden. “Please,
sir, I beg your pardon; but it’s immediate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s immediate?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, sir,” he replied, “it’s an
orderly come from Vittoria; and
brought a letter for you, sir, directed
‘immediate’ on the back of it,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you permit me?” I asked
M. le Tisanier, raising the trap-door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, this is perfectly incredible,”
said he. “Above, and all
around, I was prepared. It never
entered my thoughts that I could be
assailed from the shades below.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When I had raised the trap-door,
there appeared—not Sergeant Pegden,
but—the head of his halbert,
and three glistening bayonets, fixed
to the muzzles of three firelocks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ground arms!” I cried. “Sergeant
Pegden, show yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The muskets promptly subsided
into the darkness from which they
had emerged, and, with a letter in
his hand, the Sergeant slowly
rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>While, partly amused, partly surprised,
M. le Tisanier gazed on the
wasted form and pallid visage of
the Sergeant, who ascended like a
spectre from the grave, I took the
letter and opened it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an order to adopt immediate
measures for the removal of my
invalids to the convalescent station
at Vittoria, and then to rejoin forthwith
my regiment on the frontiers of
France, taking with me, to be exchanged
for Sir Charles Popham of
the —— light infantry, my prisoner,
Le Vicomte d’Y, lieutenant of the
—— Voltigeurs.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “M. le Vicomte, I am your
most obedient, humble servant.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “M. le Capitaine, accept the
assurances of my high consideration.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “M. le Vicomte, I have intelligence
which no doubt will gratify
you. It will be my pleasing duty to
attend you to the frontiers, there to
be exchanged.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He</em> (with nonchalance). “For an
Englishman? or for a Spaniard?”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “Happily, you are considered
my prisoner, not a prisoner of the
Spaniards. You will be exchanged
for an English officer of the same
military rank.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>He.</em> “Very good” (with much
dignity). “That is quite satisfactory
to my sense of honour. Were
it for a Spaniard, I hardly know
whether I could condescend to accept
of the exchange. By the by,
since it is as your prisoner that I am
to proceed to the frontiers, I think it
best, for reasons which you will
doubtless appreciate, that so long as
we are together I should fully maintain
that character. M. le Capitaine,
I offer you my sword.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>I.</em> “M. le Vicomte, you have taught
me that you can use your sword not
only with courage and address, but
with magnanimity. Wear it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The arrangements for our departure
were soon completed. My sick
men were conveyed to Vittoria.
With them went Sergeant Pegden
in charge, and the four French soldiers
as prisoners to the English.
Then, taking an affectionate leave of
the Padre, we joined a party of British
dragoons, who had been out on
a reconnaissance towards Pampeluna,
and with them pursued our route towards
the frontiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first day’s march took us
across undulating ground, the road
alternately dipping into valleys, and
topping the intermediate elevations.
As the Vicomte and I jogged on side
by side, I noticed that, on our reaching
the summit of each successive eminence,
he cast a furtive but anxious
look backwards, as if watching for
some party in the rear. I also looked
back, and perceived that we were
followed by a couple of mules, which
bore on their backs two wounded
Spaniards.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE WONDROUS AGE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>“Oh wondrous Mother Age!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Wondrous!—such is the title this
Age assumes. She wears it written
broadly on her phylactery, trumpets
it loudly on quay and bourse, on platforms
and at market-places, blabs
it at clubs and reading-rooms, placards
it in railway carriages, puffs it in
steam-ships; everything she buys or
sells is docqueted, everything she says
or does, engraven with the epithet—Wondrous!
This is the Age of ages—so
she says. The Golden, the
Silver, the Brazen, the Iron ages were
as nought: it combines them all,
and is grander, richer, stronger in
its fusion than any of these separate
stages. Men are now only beginning
to live. In former times
they merely dosed or daundered,
trifled or philandered, brawled or
rioted, dreamed or philosophised
through life, wasting its golden sands
in writing love-songs, and calling that—poetry;
in fighting great battles, and
calling that—heroism, chivalry; in
sitting by the midnight lamp, gathering
knowledge, which in after years
might ripen into wisdom, and calling
that—study; in sitting by hearth or
board, quaffing from the wine-cup,
drinking toasts, telling old stories,
singing old songs, and calling that—conviviality,
good-fellowship; in
giving alms to beggars, in feeding
the hunger of the idle and the vagabond,
and calling that—charity; in
uttering strong words, in doing
strong deeds, and calling that—manliness;
in upholding nationalities, and
calling that—patriotism. Such are a
few delusions in which men were
ever wrapping themselves, until the
day of enlightenment dawned, and
this Age burst upon us, with its railways
and its steam-ships, its doves
of peace and arks of commerce, its
treaties and tariffs, its leagues and
institutes, its unions and schools, its
ledgers and invoices, its cotton-mills
and manufactories—proclaiming to
the world that the true purpose of
life, the true destiny of man, was
to trade, to manufacture, to make
money and circulate it, and, through
the medium of cotton bales, silken
freights, cargoes of coal, and sacks
of corn, to fulfil the great mission of
peace and goodwill. Knowledge,
learning, courage, perseverance, mind,
thought, enterprise, strength, were
not to be utterly repudiated; they
were only to be converted to the one
purpose, driven out of the old slow
processes of development, touched
with the impulses of the time, and
quickened to a more rapid production
and circulation. What boots it that
our locomotives go at the rate of
forty, fifty, sixty miles an hour?
that our ships cross the Atlantic in
eleven days? that our electric wires
carry messages from one end of the
land to the other? that our printing-presses
throw forth papers by the
hundred and books by the thousand?
Of what use are our political economics,
our statistics, our lectures, our
leagues, our steam-power, our mechanical
inventions, our liberalism,
if men are to move, talk, think, and
legislate no faster than in bygone
days? This must be, and is, the age
of fastness,—of fast travelling, fast
talking, fast thinking, fast reading,
fast writing, of fast—no! not fast
statesmanship—not fast law. These
remain, like the old vans and coaches
in the by-roads of Cornwall and
Wales, to show the world what slow-going
was. Men must not now
await the long results of time. They
are not to sow in youth that they
may reap in old age—to labour and
conceive in patience that they may
produce in strength. The Age will
not admit of such stagnation. Its
maxim is, that the greatest production
in the shortest time, and at the
least cost, the best markets and the
quickest returns, are the only worthy
aims of labour and intellect—the only
fit investment for capital of the brain
or the pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the Age is to go on growing
stronger, busier, faster, doubling the
power of machinery, multiplying its
mills, increasing its exports and imports,
sending forth its freights, machinery,
and products as missionaries
to all lands, until, by a loving interchange
of cotton and corn, a sweet
intercourse with ledgers and bills of
exchange, men are knit together in a
beautiful unity of commerce, and
some glorious consummation be attained,
such as the poet sees in his
vision—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle’s flags were furled,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the parliament of man, the federation of the world,</div>
      <div class='line'>There the common cause of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And what is to be this universal law,
according to the Age, if not to the
poet’s meaning? Love? Honour?
Charity? Truth? Religion? These
are all old-world principles. We, in
our blindness, ever believed that love,
inspired and propagated by religion,
was to be the benign influence
which would still the discords, close
the schisms, unite the jarring creeds
and warring nationalities, soothe the
angry passions, and wither the petty
jealousies, which set man against
man, nation against nation, and bind
them in a world-wide brotherhood.
We were walking in darkness. The
illumination of this Age throws its
light upon us, and we know there are
other means to this great end: that
self-interest, the reciprocity of producers
and consumers, buyers and
sellers, the sweet persuasions of barter,
are ultimately to level nationalities,
quench the animosities of
race and creed, and create a sort of
commercial millennium, in which
Swede, Russ, and Turk, Hun, Austrian,
and Lombard, Dane and German,
are to lie down together under
one universal tariff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gold—the lust of which has been
the bitterest curse of sin, and has
ever and ever, through the long roll
of ages, begotten hatred, wrath, envy,
oppression, bloodshed, and division,—is
at last to be the peace-maker, the
love-mission of the world. This,
however, is a vision of the future—“a
wonder that shall be.” Let us
turn to the Age as it stands before
us—wondrous. All ages have had
their characteristics. There have
been ages of simplicity, ages of grandeur,
ages of heroism, ages of degeneracy,
ages of barbarism, ages of
civilisation, ages of intellect, ages of
darkness, ages of superstition, ages
of philosophy, ages of faith, ages of
infidelity—ages when men have lived
the patriarchal life, sitting under
their own vines and their own fig-trees,
tilling the ground, tending
their flocks, worshipping earnestly,
enacting justice severely—ages when
they revelled in magnificence and
luxury, spread their splendour over
the earth, and set it up in palaces
and monuments—ages in which the
strong heart and the strong deed, the
bold thought and the generous impulse,
were the master agencies, in
which strong men, brave men, noble
men, were recognised as the natural
chiefs—ages in which the earth
reeked with the pestilential vapours
of vice and dissoluteness, in which
manhood and honour had set in long
nights, and the profligate, the profane,
the sybarite, walked abroad
without scorn, and sat in high places
without shame—ages when man’s
lordship of creation was manifested
only in power over brute life, and in
the tenancy of fen, forest, and mountain—ages,
again, when culture, art,
refinement, found a ripe maturity
and gorgeous development—ages in
which the light and glory of intellect
shone on dark places, and the voices
of the gifted echoed through many
lands—ages in which such voices
were silent, and both mind and intellect
lay shrouded in thick darkness,
or veiled in twilight—ages
when men doubted, speculated, and
rationalised—ages when they accepted
superstitions as creeds, lies as living
truths, serpents for fish, stones
for bread—ages in which faith was
strong, and earnest men lived in it,
strove, fought, died for it—ages
when men, worse than devils,
neither believed nor trembled. Our
Age was none of these. It ignored,
repudiated, superseded all others.
It is the Age of production, of utility,
of circulation—to produce the utmost,
by forced processes, from brain and
muscle, man-power and steam-power,
hand and loom, energy and ingenuity,
capital and labour; and to circulate
the products with a power which almost
commands, and a rapidity which
almost outstrips the elements: this
is the great wonder of the age.</p>

<p class='c009'>Heroism, chivalry, faith, imagination,
romance—these are all at a discount
with it; they are unremunerative,
unmarketable, could not be
cashed or negotiated. Everything,
every man, is to be measured by productive
capacity or practical uses.
“He who makes a blade of corn grow
where a blade of corn ne’er grew before,
is of more service to mankind
than fifty warriors.” The wit and
politician who wrote this, or something
like it, would have stared to
see the present development of his
doctrine—to find production and
utility the great tests of progress and
civilisation. And is this progress?
Is this civilisation? So says the Age.
We had dreamed that progress was
of the mind and heart; that its
stages would be marked by the recognition
of justice, the advancement
of the knowledge which leads to wisdom,
the increase of honesty, courage,
faith, honour, truthfulness, the
growth of love, and the spread of
virtue and godliness, as well as by
census tables, statistical returns, financial
budgets, and the stock exchange.
We had dreamed that civilisation
meant mental and social development
as well as the existence of
wealth; that it must be based on
a well-balanced prosperity, which
should include a comparative equality
in the happiness of all classes,
giving each man a power of well-being
and comfort in his own sphere—the
maintenance of the due proportions
in society, and a fair ratio
in the increase of riches and the decrease
of crime; that it involved the
moral, intellectual, religious, and social
growth of man, as well as the
productiveness of his industry and
the development of his science; that
it involves the expansion of courtesy,
honour, generosity, kindliness, and
good faith, as well as the diffusion
and circulation of merchandise and
gold. Were we dreaming dreams?
Are these phantasies? So says the
Age; and we, who are living in the
glare of its noontide glory, must fain
accept its interpretations with humble
submission, and expand our faculties
to the comprehension of its wonders.
But whilst we do this, we may at
least indulge in a retrospect of the
past,—note what this great change
has cost us, and compare our losses
with our gains. This has been an
age of supercession, and ere we swell
the triumph which shall seat the conqueror
on its throne, it may be permitted
us to look back on the smouldering
walls of old homes, the
trampled fields of old principles, and
the ruined fanes of old faiths, which
it has left in its onward march—to
mourn over and bury our dead. And
what time more fitting for such a
valedictory survey than this?—now,
when the Age has paused in its career
at the grim apparition of war, and
the world is undergoing a partial relapse—now,
when heroism is once
more a power in the land, when men
are talking, exulting, and watching
over brave deeds, more than over
funds, invoices, or railway scrip—when
fair women are weeping for the
brave dead, and praying for the living
brave—now, when a great battle,
or the fall of a city, stirs a stronger
pulsation in the nation than the rise
and fall of stock, or the most stupendous
bankruptcies—now, when
old things are becoming new, and
men are looking back with tolerance,
if not with affection, on old principles
and old faiths. Let us then cast a
glance on the past—our own past—the
past of our own generation—think
of what we were, and what we are,
and strike the balance.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have little belief in the days
of merry England, or in the “good
old times,” that illusory paradise of
dullards and sluggards, who would
rather mourn over a lost Eden than
find one in the present, or look for it
in a future; but we do remember
when the land had more mirth in it
than now, when it was more romantic
and picturesque. We remember it
ere the utilitarian spirit had laid its
iron grasp on the hearts of our people,
and spread its iron network over
our fields and valleys. We remember
it less wealthy, less prosperous,
less cultivated, and we remember it
also as more genial, more joyous, and
more beautiful. A change—a great
change, almost a revolution—in our
social feelings, thoughts and habits,—in
our aims and pursuits—in the
character of the people and the features
of the country—has taken place
even in our memory. Has this change
wrought most of good or evil? We
admit that it had become a necessity
of progress that men should be shaken
out of their domesticity, their local
isolation be more centralised, and
become more cosmopolitan—that
their intercommunications should be
more rapid, their diffusion more general:
we admit that the increase of
population and labour-power demanded
that wealth should no longer be
hoarded or land be wasted, and that
every penny, every acre, should be
made productive—that some such
changes as have come upon us must
needs have come: but have we not
bought them at a price, have we not
paid for them at the cost of many
manly attributes—many social virtues—by
the loss of much rural
beauty, and many characteristics of
our pastoral life? We quarrel not
with steam, the great wonder of
the Age—the great means to the
mighty end of utilitarianism. We
know all that it has done for us—all
it has brought us. We know that
it has accelerated intercourse, impelled
industry, expanded our resources,
extended knowledge, equalised
consumption and production,
given facilities to enterprise, and opportunities
to labour. Much has it
done for our material prosperity; and
we should hail it as an altogether
beneficent agent, did we not think—God
knows whether rightly or not—that
this shuffling together of people,
this eager competition, this hot-bed
production which it has fostered, was
rapidly effacing individuality and
simplicity of character—had overstrode
that honest persevering industry
which toils on slowly and
patiently to its end, which is content
to labour and to wait—had
raised an unrest, a rapid craving
for quick results, a discontent with
appointed spheres of action, a restless
movement of classes to tread on
each other’s heels, and had decreased
their mutual trust and despondency—did
we not know that it had invaded
the seclusion of our valleys, smoked
and scorched our woods and copses,
tunnelled our rocks, cut up our
meadows, and overlaid the poesy of
nature by the materialism of traffic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Commerce and manufacture! shall
we raise our voices against them?
God forbid! Have they not been
the great agents in our prosperity?
Have they not created our wealth,
begotten our merchant princes, raised
our shipping, filled our island with
products, and circulated our own to
the ends of the earth? Have they
not promoted science, encouraged enterprise?
Have they not nourished
our colonies, given employment to
our growing millions, made this little
spot to swarm like a busy hive, and
placed it as the centre of a wide-spreading
civilisation—the heart of a
mighty organisation? Should they,
however, beget a thirst for gold—a
mad pursuit for wealth, which will
engross and absorb our thoughts and
feelings to the exclusion of generous
impulses and noble principles, hitherto
main elements in the happiness
and greatness of nations—will they
be all gain? Will not there be a
balance then—moral loss against material
gain? Answer for thyself, O
wondrous Age!</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither will we quarrel with model
farming. The competition of production,
the opening of markets, the
pressure of other classes and interests,
have forced agriculture, for the sake
of its very life and being, to adopt
utilitarianism—have compelled it to
turn every inch of ground to account.
Utility demanded that hedgerows
should be levelled, the waste patches,
knolls, and nooks ploughed up, old
pollards and groups of trees uprooted,
and that sheep and oxen, instead
of cropping the pleasant herbage
in pleasant sunny meadows,
should be cooped and stalled in
narrow spaces, fed by rule and measure,
and left to fatten in darkness;
that machinery should supersede the
reaper’s and thresher’s work, and
that crops should be stacked and
garnered as a matter of business, and
not borne home, as heretofore, with
festive rejoicings and thanksgivings.
And if the increasing number of
mouths required so many more bushels
of corn, so many more pounds of
meat, and they can be obtained only
by such means, then must the picturesque,
the poetic, and the beautiful
be sacrificed instantly and ruthlessly,
that man may eat and live.
Yes! uproot, overturn, change, overlay
them all, if thus, and thus only,
the people may be fed, the poor
have bread. The beautiful has ever
yielded to the inroads of necessity
or utility, which is a sort of modified
and modernised necessity. Yet
may we not mourn over the things
which are gone or going, the things
belonging to the outer world of the
poetic, the romantic, and the picturesque?
They are associated with
sunny holidays, with the memories
of boyhood, and the feelings of youth;
and we must mourn them, though
their extirpation be the doom of an
imperious and beneficent necessity.
We must fain mourn over those
hedgerows, as we remember them,
with their soft, grassy banks—the
nursery of early violets and gregarious
primroses—the parterre of more
gaudy daffodils, and the nestling-place
of hundreds of tiny flowerets, whose
names we knew not, but whose faces
we loved, with their tops crowned by
rich-scented hawthorn, budding hazel,
and dark-leaved sloe—with their
bases bordered by luxuriant brambles
and flowering gorse. They were
favourite haunts of ours, those hedgerows:
there we sought the early
nosegay, there we clutched at the
ripe brown clusters of nuts,—the
slip shellers, the <i><span lang="la">Spolia prima</span></i> of the
season—our hoards were gathered
elsewhere: there we stripped the
sloe-bushes of their fruit, under the
delusion that, by a long process of
hoarding in bran, they would become
luxuries, and would not set the
teeth on edge; there, with net and
ferret, or with dog and gun, we commenced
our initiation as sportsmen;
there, as Dandie Dinmont would say,
we were entered on the rabbit.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must mourn, too, for these
groves and thickets, which lay in the
intervals of cultivation like the remnants
of a conquered race amid the
conquerors. Much, very much, did
we love to thread these coverts, in the
schoolboy pursuits of nutting or bird-nesting,
or to roam in mere wantonness
through the thick underwood,
gathering an immature poetry from
the massed foliage of holly, mountain-ash,
alder, and willow—from
the tangled shades of briar, woodbine,
convolvulus, and the other
creepers which wreathed their wild
luxuriance round stem and boughs,
or trailed it in a rich undergrowth
along the ground—from the lights,
which fell soft and mellow through
the openings and through the leaves
on the long-tufted grass below, rich
with blue-bells, harebells, wild anemone,
and many another wildling;—from
the fluttering of wings, the
twitterings and the cooings of birds—from
the sweet-scented breaths—from
the solitude, and from the many
gentle influences through which nature
inspires the beautiful. These
places have glad memories—the
gladdest of all—the memories of the
full heart, the free fresh impulses,
and of growing thought. On some
such spot, too, we took our first
stand as a sportsman. We see it
even now—an opening glade, a plash
overhung with the boughs of a holly
bush—behind a knot of alders and
some tangled brushwood. Even now
we feel our heart fluttering, and our
cheek flushing, as Flush—the best of
cockers—after wagging and bustling
about in a most excited manner,
gave one sharp bark, one spring, and,
something rising before us, we fired,
and a bird fell. We had killed our
first woodcock. Utilitarianism has
waged the war of extermination
most ruthlessly against these spots,
and the gorse brakes which shone
in golden patches betwixt the fallow
and grass lands. There are few left
now. The fields are spread before us,
smooth and bare, and the corn waves
on the ground, erewhile cumbered
by old trees and brushwood, which
were of no use, save to grow berries,
give a covert to birds, rabbits, and vermin,
and to offer the eye a pleasant
spot to rest upon in the landscape.
Away with such uselessness! The
world is not large enough for such
waste.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those old pollards, too—those
venerable solitary trees which, with
their grey scarred trunks, and the
green twigs shooting from their tops,
evidences of the life still within,—seemed
to us always the very symbols
of a hale, vigorous old age, furrowed
perchance, or shrunken by time, but
crowned and flowering still with the
presence of youth. Is there not room
for them? and wilt thou, oh man! regret
also that utilitarianism has
wrought such a similitude betwixt
agriculture and manufacture,—has so
imbued both with the self-same economy
of space and material, that the
buildings and structures of the one
are as stiff, formal, and red-bricked
as the other? Yea, O Age! even so
far will our perverseness carry us.
Those old farmhouses, with their low
thatched roofs covered with grass and
lichens, their stacks of chimney, the
old tree at the gable-end, the trim
little garden and the bee-hives in
front, those old straggling farmyards
with their ivy-covered out-houses and
linheys, their pools and scattered
groups of trees, were doubtless incommodious
and wasteful, but they had
a picturesqueness in our eyes never
to be claimed by their successors.
Utility seeks not such effects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those brooks which used to meander
through pleasant meadows and
shady copses, or ripple gently over
rocks and yellow pebbles, and whose
waters are now diverted into straight
channels and narrow cuts to irrigate
land or turn wheels, are not they a
lost beauty? But there is a gain in
water-power, a saving in labour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harvest-homes—merry-makings—rural
feasts! The Age repudiates and
ignores them utterly. The land is
too poor, life too short, for such follies.
Yet do we look back lovingly on the
days when the loud shout of the
reapers announced far and wide the
cutting of the first sheaf—when the
last load was carried home, attended
by a long procession of men, women,
and boys, all rejoicing with shouts,
song, and laughter, in the plenty
which had been gathered in; and
when the event was celebrated ever
with feasts and mirth, with open-doored
hospitality, and open-handed
charity. Nor has there ever yet been
a time in the age of the world when
the fruitfulness of the earth has not
been hailed by man with joy and
triumph, or the completion of its
riches been calendared by festivity
and thankfulness. Now the goodly
sheaves are carted and thrown out
before their garners as so much manure
or so many cotton bales. “So
much the better,” says utilitarianism;
“there is so much time, so much
money saved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And are men’s stomachs, men’s
pockets, to be the all in all of consideration?
Are their hearts and
fancies not to be fed or cultured? Is
man’s labour to find the dead level
of toil, ungladdened by the sound of
rejoicing, unbrightened by hours of
mirth? Is he to see no other end
and aim in such toil than the receipt
of a few shillings at the week’s end—the
fair day’s wage for the fair
day’s work? Is this to be the sole
tie betwixt him and the soil—betwixt
him and his labour? Is life to be
stripped of all its poetic and noble
inspirations, and be reduced to a dead
materialism? Is man’s soul to become
merely the motive power in a
mechanism of profit and loss, utility
and production? Is thy civilisation
to take this form, O wondrous Age!
If so, the experiment may be a grand
one, a successful one; but the experiences
of the past, and the instincts
and sentiments of mankind, are
against it. For what do men most
love to look into the past? To seek
the useful, or the heroic and the
beautiful? Do they pore over
musty tomes, and delve into buried
cities, that they may discover the
secret of Tyrian dye and Etruscan
pottery, the system of Phœnician
commerce and the sources of Egyptian
wealth;  or that their hearts may burn
with the heroism of Marathon or
swell with the glories of Alexander,
and that the thrilling words of Pindar,
the noble thoughts of Sophocles,
the beautiful legends of Grecian mythology,
the grand truths of Grecian
history, may be their own? Do they
investigate the records of the middle
ages to understand the monetary
schemes of Lombardy and Venice, or
that they may read how men fought,
how women loved, and minstrels sang—that
they may dwell on knightly
courtesy and knightly chivalry?
Utility has, I fear, little of the study.
This may be a human error, but it is
a deep-seated and long-standing one.
What a Jeremiad to sing over a fine
old hedgerow, rotten stumps, and
barbarous customs! Not so, O Age!
It is not things themselves we mourn,
but the feelings, the principles they
nurtured or represented.</p>

<p class='c009'>Agriculture followed of necessity in
the march of utilitarianism. It was
challenged to fight for its own footing—to
struggle and compete with
its rivals in the quickness and quantity
of production. In this struggle
it gained, maybe, much strength from
its alliance with science, and added
to its resources by the applications of
art; but it lost much of the Arcadian
character, the pastoral beauty, the
simplicity of pleasure and simplicity
of toil, the simple honesty and the
generous manliness, which placed in
point of attraction the rural life next
to the heroic in men’s minds, which
invested the vocation of the husbandman
with the graces and dignity of
a higher order of labour, and wreathed
the bare facts of his toil with the garlands
of poesy and sentiment. It
was forced to strip for the race, to
throw away all its adornments, its
poetry and sentiments, and descend to
the bare remunerative materialism of
husbandry. It can no longer afford</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Those calm desires that asked but little room,</div>
      <div class='line'>Those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lived in each look, and brightened all the green.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We doubt whether the consummation,
imagined by the poet, has arrived,
when “rural mirth and manners
are no more,” but we see that they
are being fast swept into the vortex
of the great maelstrom of utilitarianism
and generalisation. Carp we at
these changes, then? We merely,
according to our first proposition,
balance gains against loss, crediting
so many more cultivated acres, so
many more turnips, so much more
corn, against the loss of picturesqueness,
the loss of many moral features
and characteristics in a class which
has hitherto been no mean element
in our commonwealth. Had the Age,
however, done no more than this, we
should not have grudged the sacrifices
thrown in the path of the great Juggernaut
of progress. Spite of railroad
and factory, there will still be beauty
enow in our land—enow for poet and
painter. It will not lie so much in
our daily paths; it will not be such
a constant presence to worker and
wayfarer; but it will still be found
by its worshippers. Even utilitarianism
cannot nullify nature or denude
the world of its Edens. Still
must the corn wave, the grasses grow,
the trees bud. Still will the “stately
homes of England” stand beautiful
“amid their tall ancestral trees
through all the pleasant land,”—the
cottage homes peep from their coverts.
Still will the mountains stand in their
grandeur, the rivers run in their gladness,
and the valleys laugh and sing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rural virtues, too, may have only
disappeared, to reappear under the
influence of a higher intelligence. At
least, we feel that a vocation, which
is carried on in the open air, in constant
communion with nature, must
ever maintain a certain healthiness of
feeling, a certain manliness of spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if this self-same utilitarianism,
which has levelled our fields, turned
our rivers, and laid open our valleys,
be also levelling and laying bare our
hearts, and frittering the great currents
of the soul into a thousand
channels—if it be overthrowing our
moral landmarks, and invading the
moral principles, which were once
laws in our social cosmos, what hast
thou, O Age, amid all thy wonders,
to balance such work?</p>

<p class='c009'>First of the levelling. We speak
not of the changes or influences of
democracy, for we have a firm belief
that the proportions of society are
determined by laws so fixed and
true, that any attempt to violate them
will eventually produce reaction;
but of the changes which are gradually
levelling and overthrowing the
moral distinctions and moral barriers
of our social life, and especially those
of age. Where is now our youth?—where
our old age? Where are our
boys?—where our old men? We have
men-boys and boy-men. But where
are the veritable boys—the boys
with eager hearts, throbbing pulses,
buoyant spirits, gay hopes, glowing
fancies, unreasoning beliefs, and
ready faith—the boys with the young
thoughts and the young feelings
gushing through them like the juices
of young life—the boys who hail
their stage of existence joyfully,
gathering its pleasures, battling its
sorrows, and venting its impulses; not
striving and straining after an unripe
knowledge and a forced maturity?
Where are now our veritable grey-beards—the
old men who calmly, and
of course, enter on their stage of life
assuming its dignities, claiming its
privileges, and fulfilling its functions;
separating themselves from the turbid
action, the toil and strife of the
world, and reposing honourably in the
retirement of experience and council;
not clinging to the semblance of
foregone periods, not envying the
energies of youth or the prime of
manhood, but keeping alive the memories
and feelings of both to ray
their declining day with mellow
light—the old men who rejoiced to
wear their grey hairs as a crown of
glory, and stood amid their fellows
with their hoary heads, their wise
hearts, and their brows engraven
with the lines of thought like</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The white almond-trees full of good days.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Such a man the poet draws—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Behold a patriarch of years, who leaneth on the staff of religion;</div>
      <div class='line'>His heart is fresh, quick to feel, a bursting fount of generosity.</div>
      <div class='line'>He, playful in his wisdom, is gladdened in his children’s gladness;</div>
      <div class='line'>He, pure in his experience, loveth in his son’s first love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lofty aspirations, deep affections, holy hopes are his delight;</div>
      <div class='line'>His abhorrence is to strip from Life its charitable garment of Idea.</div>
      <div class='line'>The cold and callous sneerer, who heedeth of the merely practical,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mocketh at good uses in imaginary things,—that man is his scorn;</div>
      <div class='line'>The hard unsympathising modern, filled with facts and figures,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cautious and coarse, and materialised in mind,—that man is his pity.</div>
      <div class='line'>Passionate thirst for gain never hath burnt within his bosom;</div>
      <div class='line'>The leaden chains of that dull lust have not bound him prisoner:</div>
      <div class='line'>The shrewd world laughed at him for honesty, the vain world mouthed at him for honour;</div>
      <div class='line'>The false world hated him for truth, the cold world despised him for affection:</div>
      <div class='line'>Still he kept his treasure, the warm and noble heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in that happy wise old man survive the child and lover.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Such men may still exist, scattered
like old pollards over the levelled
face of society; but they are not thy
products, not the results of thy materialism,
O Age! The youth which
opens under thy auspices, and runs
by thy creeds, cannot sow the seeds
of such a harvest. The youth
formed under thy influences and action
will have no growth, will not
know the natural processes of maturation—“First
the blade, then the
ear, after that the full corn in the
ear.” Thy youth will be put up and
fashioned like a piece of mechanism,
set to work like a steam-engine,
moving ever by the same hard heavy
material laws,—so much speed from
so much power, so much knowledge
from so much pressure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a morning cannot end in the
even we have pictured. “The
merely practical,” “the facts and
figures,” “the exacting coarse materialism
of mind,” “the passionate
thirst,” will be “the leading chains”
which must bind the old age of the
man who lives by thy doctrines and
fulfils thy theories. Affection, feeling,
imagination, faith, cannot
wreathe or foliage the hoar trunk,
for these will have been long before
lopped off and withered by “that
solid falsehood, the material.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Truly the tendency of thee and thy
utilitarianism, O Age! is to materialise
the beginning and end of life—to
take from youth its freshness
and romance, from old age its geniality
and repose; and better so, thou
sayest, for thus will its space, its
strength, and its energies, be concentrated
on the great producing period
manhood, and not expended in boyish
frolics and follies—in the maunderings
and idleness of dotage. Why
should there be these waste places in
life? “Is not youth the preparation
for manhood, and old age its
result?” Is it not right, therefore,
that our youth should not be fed on
nursery tales, prurient fancies, fiction,
poetry, and high-flown sentiment,
but be early imbued with the solid
facts, the useful knowledge, the
rules of science, and the power of
calculation, which will fit it to play its
part well and ably in the great battle
of utility? And why should old age
rest, sink into placid inaction? If it
cannot labour, cannot it scheme and
calculate and speculate, till the brain
begin to err, and the mind to fail in
its correctness?—then, indeed, let it
be thrown aside like an old file, or
used-up machine, to moulder and decay.
It were well said, O Age! if
life had no uses save the practical—if
this world were merely one great
warehouse, one great mart, one mass
on which trade and manufacture
were to erect their <em>fulcra</em>, and were
not, as it is, covered and filled with
the beautiful and sublime; if man
were a machine of brain, muscle, and
bone, and not endowed with heart
and soul, the divine sparks of vitality;
if he were to live by bread
alone, or be judged by his gold,—then,
indeed, ’twere well said and
well done. But whilst beauty and
sublimity still exist as elements of
the physical cosmos, and heart and
soul of the moral; whilst we know
the glorious thoughts and glorious
deeds which the study and culture of
them has produced through all time,
we cannot but think that they will
still be, as ever, chief agencies in
this great world of ours; we cannot
but think that the beautiful and sublime,
reflected on heart and soul,
should now, as ever, radiate in the
warm impulses, pure worship, and
warm imaginings of youth, and beam
round age in the sunset hues of a
summer day. What are their uses,
sayest thou? What are spring and
autumn to the seasons? What morn
and even to the day? Shall there be
no more spring shooting of leaves—no
bursting buds, no fluttering or
carollings of spring life? Shall there
be no brown leaves, no fallow, no
mellow fruit? Shall there be no
rosy lights of morn, no jocund sounds
or pleasant sights of waking life?
Shall there be no gorgeous sunsets,
no calm splendour of declining day?
Is life to toil and sit henceforth under
summer heat, and abide ever in the
blaze and glare of noonday, rising
only in the glimmer of infancy, and
setting in the cold gleam of twilight?
Shall the bounding step, the joyous
laugh, the free heart, generous
thought, and intuitive heroism, be no
longer the attributes of our youth?
Have these no uses? Do they cast
no bright lights on a land, raise no
pleasant echoes? Have they no
genial influences, no glad inspirations
for the working world? Shall
we no longer see the glorious sight—to
us the most sublime spectacle
which human life or the world can
offer—the sight of a man resting in
old age from his labours, not estranging
himself from the world, but
weaning his thoughts from its cares
and turmoil, holding still by its affections
and memories, but gently withdrawing
his spirit from the strife, to
prepare it by repose for the great
emancipation it is expecting? Has
this no uses? Has it no grand lessons—no
sublime teachings—no infinite
suggestions? Does it shed no
blessing or holiness around—nor reflect
a ray of its own peacefulness
on striving, toiling men? And are
these things nought, and shall they
not be? Wilt thou dare, O Age!
to cast thy spell over youth and old
age, and thus sacrifice to thy materialism
and utility the periods which
God has sanctified to the highest
manifestations of spiritualism—to the
purest developments of innocence,
love, truth, and faith—to the richest
perfectedness of peace, purpose, and
wisdom?</p>

<p class='c009'>We have seen somewhat of the
system by which thou nurturest thy
youth, and like not it nor its results.
We love not the <em>Lanista</em>, gladiatorial
training by which heart and imagination
are rubbed, starved, and sweated
down—and the mind fed, the intellect
exercised, for the merely material
struggle—the combat of facts and
realities—the great game of profit
and loss. We love not the training,
nor love we those who undergo it.
They have not, in our eyes, the loveliness
or the lovableness which we
used to associate with the image of
youth. Young without youth, old
without maturity, young in form, old
in heart and brain, they stand before
us, keen, sharp, and confident;
strong in a knowledge of facts, dates,
and tables—a knowledge unleavened
by the touches of imagination, unsoftened
by modesty, unmoved by
the freshness and simplicity which
give such beauty to youth, and
which sometimes make even the
wisdom of manhood bow to its intuitions,
confessing with the German
philosopher, that “the fresh gaze of
the child is richer in significance than
the forecasting of the most indubitable
seer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In what spirit dost thou lead them
to the first study—the book of nature?
Dost thou spread it before
them as a book of God, that they
may see its great wonders, learn its
great lessons, perceive its great symbols,
learn its great poesy, and inhale
its great sublime worship,—not comprehending
all at once, but gathering
them in, for future thought and
future perception? Is it thus thou
presentest nature to thy children, or
not rather as a science and mechanism,
the laws, rules, times and measurements
of which they must learn
and master, forgetting or heeding not
the great principles which these represent,
the great system of which
they are a part? Thy children are
taught accurately the distances between
stars and the times of their
movements; they can babble of
strata and formation, explain the
secrets of tide, and current, and
the law of storms; classify plants,
from the hyssop on the wall to the
cedar which groweth on Lebanon,
and name scientifically the shells on
the sea-shore; but we seldom hear
them talk of the glory of the heavens
or the beauty of the earth, or the
wonders of the sea, or point to them
as types and revelations of the Power
which made and moveth in them all.
Nature, with her laws and changes,
appeareth in thy schools as the result
of mechanic forces and chemical combinations.
If thou teachest more
than this, we find it not in thy books,
in thy public teachings, or in the
minds of thy pupils! Is it not the
same with other studies? History,
science, and poesy are, with thee, so
abridged, extracted, epitomised, and
tabulated, that only facts are left for
the memory, not thought for the
mind. All the noble examples,
the heroic deeds, the noble thoughts,
and great principles which they recorded
or contained, are carefully
suppressed or parodied; for what
have they to do with the practical
work on which this generation is
about to enter? Thus with their
catechisms and manuals, thy pupils,
learning without reverence, thinking
without feeling, knowing without
believing, unencumbered by modesty,
unchecked by impulse, enthusiasm, or
imagination, can rush at once into
the arena, ready and confident. And
in choosing this system of training
and education, thou art wise in thy
generation—wise as the serpent—for
by what other couldst thou hope to
raise men, who, eschewing nobleness,
and aspiring not to greatness—who,
rejecting antecedents and abandoning
individuality, shall swell the
throng of money-getters, buyers,
sellers, producers, contractors, speculators,
and other zealots of utility,
and thus elevate thee to the height
of practical glory, thus make thee still
more wondrous!</p>

<p class='c009'>Such men thou wilt have, such men
thy system must make; but to quote
more eloquent words and thoughts
than our own, “If we read history
with any degree of thoughtfulness,
we shall find that the checks and
balances of profit and loss have
never been the grand agents with
men; that they have never been
roused into deep, thorough, all-pervading
efforts by any commutable
prospect of profit and loss, for any
visible finite object, but always for
some invisible and infinite one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ages, in which self-interest has
been the one pervading principle,
this world has seen before: such an
age was that of Louis XV., only that
then pleasure, not profit, was the
prevailing object; lust, not mammon,
the presiding deity. Such an
era is being now enacted across the
Atlantic. There self-interest, in the
shape of mammon, is running its race
boldly and fiercely, unstayed by old
traditions, old memories, or old institutions,
and is exhibiting to the
world, in all its glory and success, the
reign of the practical, the triumph of
utility. Let thy admirers, followers,
pupils, study these well, ere they
rush on their onward career.</p>

<p class='c009'>We, personally, stand aghast at
thy offspring. They terrify us by
their unripe shrewdness and “Smallweed”
wisdom. Though verging on
the period of the sere and yellow
leaf, we ever loved the companionship
of boys, and were considered
rather a good fellow by them. We
could discuss the shape of a bat,
the colour of a fly, the merits of
a pony, or the distinction of prison
bar and prison base, pretty well,
and at a push could even talk respectably
of the stories of old Virgil, the
marches of Xenophon, or the facetiæ
of Horace. This was all well. But
one does not now dare to touch one
of these young prodigies without a
fear that he will forthwith shoot an
arrow from his quiver of facts and
dates, by deliberately asking, how far
Saturn is from the Earth, or at what
rate sound travels, or what is the
population of China, or the date of
the Council of Nice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our flesh quakes even now, and a
cold perspiration comes over us, at the
thought of the intellectual contests we
shall have to undergo with our firstborn.
That child-man haunts us like
a phantom. The vision sits upon us
like a nightmare. We believe him
to be our lawfully-begotten offspring,
but he will be thy child, O Age;
child of thy nurture, of thy circumstances,
thy influences. Thou wilt
be the she-wolf who will suckle him!
We see him grown formal, knowing,
and conceited, battering us with
questions from his catechisms, ’ologies,
tables, and measures. We are not
yet resolved how to meet this coming
contest; whether to read up covertly
for the emergency, or to follow an
expedient once successfully adopted
by a patriarch of our experience—that
of affecting to despise and pooh-pooh
all elementary knowledge as
beneath and unworthy of him. Yes;
we see this our offspring, and we
know him chiefly by negatives,
chiefly by contrast with boys of our
own youth. We know that he will
be more proper, discreet, and decorous
than ourselves or our contemporaries.
We know that he will not
be misled by impulse or sympathy;
that his mind will never be led from
Euclid or Greek grammar, by the
ringing of some old rhyme in his
brain, or the memory of some old
joke, or the thought of the green
fields and green woods on which the
sun is shining without; that his pulse
will not beat quick at reading of the
heroic three hundred at Thermopylæ;
that he will perhaps vote the Horatii
and Camillus humbugs; pronounce
the <cite>Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite>
an idle tale, and the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
a collection of fooleries; that he will
never believe in ghosts, and will
smile scornfully at the mention of
fairies and pixies; that he will never
risk a flogging for the sake of <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite> or <cite>Roderick Random</cite>;
that <cite>Childe Harold</cite> and <cite>Don Juan</cite>,
so sedulously kept from us, may
safely be left within his reach; that
he will never secrete the family
tinder-box, or tear leaves from his
father’s logbook to make bonfires on
the 5th of November; that he will
never give, except a <i><span lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i>; or
play, except with a calculation of
gain or loss. Will he ever know a
boy’s love? Yes, perhaps, but he
will pursue it calmly and discreetly,
like a man and a gentleman; will
approach his inamorata without diffidence,
and talk to her without hesitation.
Not such was our boy’s love;
not thus did we go through that
ordeal of beating pulse and rushing
thought. To our recollection, we
never spoke six words to the object of
our adoration, and never entered her
presence without blushing or stammering;
but the sight of her flaxen curls
and blue eyes at the window would
set our brain in a whirl, and a smile
or bob of the curls would cause such
a beating of the heart that we forthwith
set off at topmost speed, and
were only stopped by loss of breath
or wind. After all such interviews,
the said curls and eyes, and certain
frilled trousers with which our deity
was generally invested, would come
dancing in on every mote and sunbeam,
drawing off eye and thought
from slate or book; and the memory
of the many occasions on which we
ate cane on account of such distractions,
still causes a tingling in the
regions devoted to flagellation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will he be a sportsman? Probably,
but scientifically and unenthusiastically.
We think not that
he will ever mingle with his sport
that love of wood and fell, stream
and river, rock and waterfall, cloud
and sunshine, leaf and spray, without
which rod and gun would be to
us as vain and idle implements.
We know that he will never sleep
in barn or outhouse to be early by
the side of the stream or cover; that
he will never invest pocket-money
in flies, until their fitness for the
season or stream has been well
tested; that he will never, in anticipation
of a raid on hare or rabbit,
collect and lock up all the curs
and mongrels in the neighbourhood,
thereby delighting his parents by
a midnight serenade. Will he delight
in feasts and revelry? Yes;
but staidly and soberly, dressed in
fitting costume, conducting himself
decorously, and talking on most
proper topics. He will never, methinks,
taste the luxury of banqueting
on potatoes and sausages roasted
in the cinders of a bonfire, or
rejoice in the irregular joviality of
harvest-home, village feast, or dancing
in a barn. Wretch that we are!
the shadows of such things cling
lovingly to the skirts of our memory.
One occasion we remember especially.
It was the custom of our
<em>locale</em>, that every village should
have a day appointed for a feast,
and on this all doors were opened,
all friends welcomed from far and
near. On such a day we crossed
accidentally the threshold of a
yeoman friend, and were dragged
forthwith to a board literally groaning
under the weight of a piece of
beef of nameless form, a kid-pie
made in a milk-pan, a plum-pudding
ditto, with other delicacies of the
like light kind. After trying our
digestion, and working our wicked
will on them, we adjourned to the
barn, and there, claimed as a partner
by a cherry-cheeked daughter of our
host, we had to confront the struggle
of a country-dance or jig, which or
what we know not now, and knew
not then. It was a fair trial to
dance each other down. A bumpkin
at our elbow looked on us with
invidious rivalry, and commenced at
once most outrageous operations with
heel and toe. Our partner rushed
recklessly on her fate. We felt misgivings
as to our own powers. The
limbs grew weak, the breath faint.
We looked at the Cherry-cheeks; a
few oily drops were trickling down
them. We felt encouraged. Presently
the steps of our bumpkin fell more
fitfully and irregularly. Again we
looked at the Cherry-cheeks; the
moisture was streaming down now
in copious rivulets. Bumpkin at
last went off in a convulsive fling,
and Cherry-cheeks, with a groan
and a sigh, confessed herself beaten.
We stood conqueror on the field.
It was our first and last saltatory
triumph. We have never before or
since gained éclat in the mazy.
Blush not for thy parent, child of
our love, but throw thy mantle
decently over his delinquencies! No
such escapades will ever disturb the
regular mechanism of the life which
thou and thy comrades will lead!</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus we trace him onwards by
negatives from a youth without
enthusiasm to a manhood without
generosity or nobleness—a perfect
machine, with the parts well adjusted
and balanced, regulated to a
certain power, fitted to work for
certain ends by certain means—the
end profit, the means the quickest
and cheapest which can be found.
As such a man, he will be a richer
and shrewder one than his forefathers,
and gain more distinction—perhaps
become a railway director,
have pieces of plate presented to
him at public dinners, die a millionaire
or a beggar, and be regarded
hereafter, according to success, as
a great man or a swindler. Such,
O Age! is the distinction, and the
reverse, which thou offerest to thy
children!</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes; so bigoted are we, that we
would not exchange the memory of
days spent on green banks, with the
water rippling by and the bright
sky above us—of nights passed with
an old friend—of hours of loving
commune with the gifted thoughts
and gifted tongues of other days—the
memory of the wild impulses,
fervid thoughts, high hopes, bounding
sympathies, and genial joys of
our past—a past which we hope to
carry on as an evergreen crown for
our old age—even to play for such a
high stake, and win.</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot test thee so well by
old age, for the old men now standing
in this generation are not wholly
of thy begetting; but, judging by the
law of consequences, we can foretell
that material youth and material
manhood must lead to a material
old age; that souls long steeped in
reekings from the presses of Profit,
and bound for years in the chains of
Utilitarianism, cannot readily escape
from their pollution and bondage;
and we can see also, even now, the
dark shadow of the present passing
over the spirits of men who began
their career in a past. Old age is
not, as of yore, a privileged period.
Men no longer recognise and value
it as a distinction, nor aspire to it
as to an order having certain dignities,
privileges, and immunities, like
the old men at Rome, who were
granted exemption from the heavy
burden of state duty, and served
her by their home patriotism and
counsel. Men love not now to be
considered or to become old; they
fight against this stage of life by
devices and subterfuges, and strive
to stave off or disguise its approaches.
Nor are they so much to blame.
The relations of age are changed; it
holds not the same consideration or
position as in former days, receives
not reverence and deference as its due
homage, nor is accorded by common
consent an exemption from attack,
a freedom of warning and counsel.
The practical workers of to-day
would as soon think of bowing to
the hoary head or wise heart of a
man past his labours, as to the remains
of a decayed steam-engine or
broken-down spinning-jenny. The
diseased faculties of old age are to
them as the <i><span lang="la">disjecta membra</span></i> of
worn-out mechanism. It is this non-estimation,
this non-appreciation,
which drives men to ignore and
repudiate the signs and masks of a
period which brings only disability
and disqualification, and makes them
cling by every falsehood, outward
and inward, to the semblance of
youth—very martyrs to sham and
pretence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not always thus. Within
our own experience, men at a certain
time of life assumed a change of
dress, habits, and bearing—not
relinquishing their vocations and
amusements, but withdrawing quietly
from the <em>mêleé</em>, and becoming
quiet actors or spectators; thus
signifying that they were no longer
challengers or combatants, but rather
judges and umpires in the great tussle
of life. We remember with what
respect we used to regard these as
men set apart—a sort of lay priesthood—an
everyday social house of
peers—a higher court of council and
appeal. How deeply we felt their rebukes
and praises; with what reverence
we received their oracles, whether
as old sportsmen, old soldiers, old
scholars, or old pastors. These men
are becoming few, for such feeling
in regard to them is dying out or
extinct. Your young utilitarian
would show no more mercy to a
grey-haired veteran, than the barbarians
did to the senatorial band of
Rome, but would indifferently hurl
Cocker at his head, or joust at him
with his statics.</p>

<p class='c009'>How many classes of these old men,
familiar to this generation, are disappearing!
We will not touch on the
old gentleman, the old yeoman, and
others; their portraits have been
drawn most truly already, and are
impressed on most of our memories;
but we must mourn over them with a
filial sorrow, believing, O Age! that
the high honour, dignity, worth,
courage, and integrity by which they
tempered society, were of more use to
it than the artificial refinement, multiplied
conveniences, rabid production,
and forced knowledge which thou
callest civilisation—that the moral
virtues which they represented were
more precious to a people, and more
glorious to a nation, than the products
and wonders of thy mechanism!
If thou has bereft us of these, it will
be hard to strike the balance!</p>

<p class='c009'>One class we miss entirely—the
old clergymen. Taunt us not, O Age!
with the fox-hunting, hard-drinking,
hard-riding parsons of the last generation.
We knew them too, and
knew many whose burden of delinquencies
in regard to horse, hound,
gun, and wine-cup, leavened as they
often were by kindly charities and
loving sympathies, will perhaps sit as
lightly as that of many a well-oiled,
smooth-going machine of capital, who
sets the moral tone for our time. We
speak not of these, but of the mild evangelists—the
gentle brothers whose
benevolent faces still beam on our
memory; whose gentle words, unmixed
with the gall of controversy or
the fearfulness of commination, fell
often sweetly on our hearts. These
lived ere this age discovered that the
gospel of Christ required a new development,
and the religion of God a
new adaptation to the purposes and
destinies of man. In many of the
quiet sequestered villages of England,
pastors who were content to preach
and live as their Master had preached
and lived, delivering His promises
and commands gently and lovingly,
and following faithfully His behest in
visiting the sick, and comforting the
afflicted—many such it was our lot
to see and hear. A servant of our
household often took us, in our childhood,
as the companion of her Sunday
holiday. This woman was most
erratic in her devotions, and wandered
indiscriminately from fold to
fold—now sitting under the Established
Church, now under Wesleyan,
Brionite, or Ranter. Many a field-preaching
and conventicle meeting
have we attended in consequence,
much to the scandal of an orthodox
aunt. As she loved, however, to
mingle creature-comforts with her
religious exercises, we more often visited
some friendly yeoman, and went
with him and his family to the village
church. Pleasant is the memory
of many of these Sabbaths; the walk
through a quiet lane, or by a shady
wood-path; the entry through the sequestered
churchyard, with its grass-green
graves, ‘neath which the forefathers
of the hamlet slept; the church,
simple and unadorned, where</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>—the minister, reverend and benignant,
earnest in entreaty, meek in
rebuke—all these are pleasant memories.
We knew these pastors better
afterward, but this was often our first
acquaintance. Oft have we asked for
them since. Their places now know
them no more. In their pulpits and
by their altars, stand men who would
impose religion on their fellows as a
ceremonial, or inflict it as a penance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where, too, are the companions,
the fellow-workers of these old pastors,
the old-fashioned sisters of charity;
those dear old ladies who, with
hearts warmed and opened by the
affections of their own social life, went
forth from their hearths to the homes
of the poor, dropping here a word of
comfort, here of admonition, here an
alms, here a book, and leaving ever
behind them a sense of true sympathy
and kindly interest? They knew not—so
dark was their age—that a regular
organisation, discipline, and
uniform, a prescribed drill and manuals,
were necessary to the perfection
of their mission. Their charity was
a natural feeling, not an instituted
effort; their admonition a friendly
appeal, not a systematised summons
to reform and penitence; their kindness,
an intuition unset to rule; their
books, the selection of their own reading,
not the licensed and revised issue
of repositories and societies. They
were the ducts by which many an
unseen stream of benevolence flowed
into poor houses. Strange to say, too,
though unaided by tea-drinkings,
public meetings, bazaars, societies,
public lists of subscribers, and all
the recognised mechanism of modern
charity, they had always the wherewithal
to give; and almsgiving, as
they gave, brought no pain or mortification,
injured no sense of self-dependence,
and left no moral degradation.
They did good in their time—a
time when individual endeavour
did the work of institutions and corporations,
but have passed away now,
and are superseded by a very different
caste. Their successors march upon
us, a stern, zealous, resolute, and to
us rather a grim sisterhood—the
trained-bands of morality and charity.
They are an order having outward
and inward forms. The outward sign
seems to be sad-coloured raiment; and
when we see a young lady dismiss the
bows from her bonnet, and adopt a
grey shawl, we know that she is about
to rush on her vocation as a district
visitor. They have rules and codes,
an appointed task, and appointed
order; and, when duly organised and
drilled, advance on some benighted
town or village, each cohort attacking
a quarter with the stern determination
to trample down and drive out poverty,
vice, and uncleanliness wherever
they may be found. They are a moral
police, detective and repressive, each
on a separate beat, rushing down
courts and through alleys in pursuit
of want and immorality. They may
fulfil their work, these sisters, and we
wish them good speed; but we believe
that they must first clothe their charity
with more love, and learn especially,
what their predecessors knew
so well, how to speak to the poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>We loved those good old sisters
and their work. One, whom we remember
well—thanks be to God—still
walks this earth, doing her beautiful
mission of love and charity.
How or when she began this mission
we know not. It was no sudden
adoption, no result of sudden conviction
or disappointed hope. We never
remember her except as engaged in
this genial task. It grew with her
growth, as the natural ripening of
early sympathies and early feelings.
Bred, as gentles often were in those
barbarous times, to regard the poor
as their lowly friends, and to keep
up a kindly intercourse with them,
she had come to know their characters
and their little histories, to understand
their peculiar ways, and to
learn to address them in the language
by which alone the poor are moved,—the
language of the heart. Thus,
as time went on, the kindly greetings
and kindly interest expanded easily
into the higher offices of comfort, instruction,
and relief. The transition
was natural, and the people wondered
not to see one whom they had
known, loved, and revered so long,
moving among them as a ministering
angel of good, chasing darkness from
the hours of the bedridden by her
pleasant converse, uplifting the soul
of some stricken sufferer by her cheering
presence, bringing relief to the
indigent, or dropping on the ears of
some blind or aged Christian the precious
words of Gospel writ. Great,
too, was she in the nursery and by
fireside, as we knew full well, and as
another generation is now experiencing.
What rhymes she knew, and
what stories she told, and how she
told them! and how have her love
and pleasantness followed us from infancy
up to manhood! By the by,
what story-tellers there were in those
days! The art seems lost at present.
People compose their talk now, and
the faculty of easy telling a natural
narrative is getting rare indeed. Patient
and gentle, thus for many years
she pursued her loving mission, without
the parade of circumstances or
ostentation of duty, and without a
murmur; though, in later years, she
became the channel of all indiscriminate
benevolence, and the director of
all general charities. No outward
humility of garb or look distinguished
this our sister. She went forth
even on her errands—lady as she was—apparelled
after the fashion of her
order. Nay, it must be confessed
that she rather loved a handsome
cloak or bonnet, nor thought them
unbeseeming her mission; for she
could not understand, nor can we,
why acts of charity should be done,
like deeds of penitence, in serge and
sackcloth. One of her functions was
a great mystery to us. Ever and anon
mention was made of a certain bag,
in connection with certain women.
We used to wonder, in our small way,
what this could mean; and discovered
at last that she was manager of a
Lying-in Society, which distributed
bags containing all the requisites for
ladies expecting that interesting event,
and that the bag in the gift of our
house was in yearly requisition for a
matron, whose habit it was regularly
to increase an already swarming
brood of white-headed, freckle-faced
urchins, who, as soon as they could
crawl, seized on gutter and dunghill
as their natural heritage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her labours were not, however,
confined to the homes of the poor,
but extended to a field from which
most would have shrunk—the prison.
Even there, amid the reprobate and
the vile, she carried her teachings
and her charity, and strove, by earnestness
and tenderness, to reclaim
and raise her fallen sisters. Many
was the rebuff she met with—many
the scoff from profligate lips; but still
she was neither daunted nor deterred.
Vice had for her no pollution, no repulsion;
still she persevered; and
though her words were often spoken
in pain, yet may they often have
brought comfort to some sin-laden
heart, or awoke contrition in some
first sinner. As instances of her failures
and disappointments, she used
often to tell, with a playful humour,
slightly dashed by sorrow, how a
woman, who had frequently been a
tenant of the jail, and had always
left in a feigned state of repentance,
on her coming, for the sixteenth time,
greeted her with, “Well, ma’am, I
must surely be converted this time.”
Perhaps the mild teachings and sweet
truths, so often told, may, after many
days, have been as bread cast on the
waters, even to this hardened heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gentle sister! loving heart! thou
didst thy mission in love. There be
those coming after thee who will employ
threat, rebuke, and discipline,
where thou wert wont to use persuasion,
and strive to force or torture
mankind into goodness by forms and
penitential processes. They may succeed;
but we believe, as thou didst,
that God’s work is to be done by
gentle influences; that God’s messages
should fall on the heart softly as
evening dew; that God’s truths should
shine on the understanding like the
summer sunshine; that God’s promises
should be wafted on the soul
with the gentleness and fragrance of
a south wind. Sweetly does the memory
of thy good deeds rest on many
a heart, and sweetly, doubtless, has
their incense risen to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were other old ladies, too,
who had no mission save that of
their gentle degree, whom we regard
as goodly relics of a past—the old
gentlewomen who sat and moved in
a certain state and stateliness, and
surrounded themselves with a dignity
which won deference from those who
approached them. We associate
these with high-backed chairs, in
wainscoted parlours, hung with dark
portraits, with old folio picture-bibles;
with pleasaunces and
laurelled walks—with avenues and
parterres—with peacocks and Blenheim
spaniels—with gold-headed
canes, ebony cabinets, and wondrous
coiffures. We defend not those headdresses;
they stand in evidence
against us, in back numbers of the
<cite>Ladies’ Magazine</cite>. But we remember
sitting with great pride at our
first play, between two turbans—one
yellow, one pink—and recollect
regarding the large gold-faced watches
which hung pendent from the girdles
of our patronesses, as an almost
Aladdin realisation of wealth and
splendour. Lovely were these
gentlewomen often, in the richness
and mellowness of their decline, illustrating,
by their serenity and
peaceful repose, the beauty and holiness
of grey hairs—not mocking old
age in a caricature of youth, nor
scaring young hearts by the skeleton
image of their own life.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were old women, too, whom
we regret—old servants, old nurses—garrulous,
chattering, snuffy old
gossips! O Age! they were pleasant
old women withal; told pleasant
stories; had an unprofitable habit,
when their functions ceased, of regarding
those whom their care had
brought into the world with a sort
of foster affection, and had a pleasant
way of bringing back, by story and
anecdote, the image of our infancy.
These reminiscences were not, however,
always gratifying to stripling
pride. We remember once, when
standing six feet without our boots,
and arrayed in our first London suit,
being rather humbled at hearing of a
period when we hadn’t a shirt to our
backs, and might have been squeezed
into a quart pot.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have done with the old age of
the past; let it sleep its sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>We could instance much more
fully, O Age! the levelling tendencies
of thy materialism. But if it be
true—and surely there must be proof
before us—that thy doctrines are
shading the brightness of youth, and
mumming the majesty of old age,
then do we know enough to be certified
that those are not all gain!
Ring out the table of thy exports,
exult over the lists of thy shipping,
the number of thy markets, the increase
of population, the multiplication
of comforts and conveniences, the
rapidity of thy communications, the
spread of thy education! Yet still
would we say, Woe to the land
whose youth is not as a vision of
gladness! woe to the land where old
age is not reverend or revered! Such
a land may know a material prosperity,
a commercial greatness which shall
dazzle the world—may produce men,
able in counting-house and on bourse—men
ready in speech and debate;
but it will not, we think, possess the
elements which produce the great qualities—the
Heroic—the Poetic—the
Moral—the Truthful—on which
hitherto have been built the grand
structures of the world’s glory. Nor
do we think that it would retain
virtue enough to continue a line of
merchant princes, such as England
has ever rejoiced to number among
her great men.</p>

<p class='c008'>A social phenomenon of much
interest has recently arisen in Great
Britain, and it is one which as yet
has no counterpart in other countries.
We allude to the practice, now become
systematic, of the delivery of
public addresses and lectures by the
leading men of the nation. We do
not refer to the ordinary lectures contracted
for by literary institutions,
through which the grown-up public
supply themselves with important
knowledge not obtainable by them in
youth at our universities, and for the
study of which indeed the brief curriculum
of youth has no spare time.
The phenomenon to which we allude
is something beyond this; it is not
stipendiary in character and regular
in appearance, but gratis and desultory.
It is a spontaneous step taken
by men of standing in the world of
politics or literature, with the view of
adding to the knowledge, improving
the social condition, or influencing
the political sentiments of their fellow-countrymen.
A century ago the
only medium of publishing facts and
propagating opinions, was the excellent
but limited one of books; the
last half-century has seen the mighty
engine of the Press attain to full
power, diffusing views and statements
with less accuracy and impartiality
than books, but with infinitely greater
speed and wider range. As newspapers
are commercial adventures,
they naturally seek, as their first object,
to enunciate views acceptable to
the class to whom they address themselves;
and hence, whenever any party
in the country happens to attain a great
preponderance over its rivals, that
preponderance is followed by an increase
of newspapers in that interest,
which in turn tends to augment the
preponderance, it may be, even into
a tyranny. And accordingly, at
times when party-spirit runs high,
the side which chances to possess
a virtual monopoly of the newspaper
press has it in its power,
by bold assertion and frequent iteration,
to make any misrepresentation
or false charges against an antagonist
pass generally current as truth, and
at the same time keep from view the
real principles by which the opposite
party are animated. We cannot but
regard the recent great development
which the practice of making public
addresses has obtained amongst us as
in some degree a reaction against this
natural one-sidedness of the newspaper
press, and, on the whole, as the happiest
remedy for it that can be devised.
For by this means, without
the aid of the restricted arena of Parliament,
public men of all ranks and
parties become the defenders of their
own actions, the exponents of their
own policy; and, moreover, to a
great extent, can thus make the newspapers
record at least all sides of the
question.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the whole, we regard the rise
of this social phenomenon with much
satisfaction. It is the best safeguard,
and an ever-living protest, against
that worst of all tyrannies, the tyranny
of Public Opinion. As yet even
America, where it is most needed,
has hardly begun to develop the practice;
and this not from want of toleration
(though the tyranny of the
majority be more pressing there than
here), but rather from a want of the
class from which the chief public
speakers of England proceed. American
society is not old enough, or rich
enough, to have yet given birth to the
two classes of public men and literary
men, which give such bloom and power
to the British commonwealth, and
which, mutually aiding and correcting
one another, together form a vast
and distinguished caste, whose services
go directly to instruct, elevate,
and guide the general community. In
America, the development of Mind as
a separate profession, has as yet made
but little progress, because the general
community is still not rich enough
to support a separate literary class of
much extent; and their public men,
though many of them distinguished
by elevated talents, belong in the aggregate
to a class entirely dependent
for support upon industrial pursuits,
the personal direction of which they
cannot afford to abandon without
pecuniary compensation, and to which
they immediately return as soon as
released from their legislatorial duties.
In Great Britain, on the other hand,
our public men are men of substance,
who can afford to devote their time
wholly to the service of the country,
and who in very many cases are trained
from their youth to statesmanship as
a profession. Such men are proud
of their noble profession; to them,
their character as legislators and administrators
is all in all; and they
lose no opportunity of righting themselves
with, and impressing their individual
views upon the country at
large. Hence the frequent public
addresses delivered by our leading
statesmen during the Parliamentary
recess; and even when Parliament
is sitting, not seldom do our public
men seek a congenial audience out
of doors, to which they may make
a profession of sentiments which
perhaps would be very coldly received
from their place in the House.
Of late it has been the Peelites and
Cobdenites who have stood most in
need of this appeal against public
opinion; and the studious efforts
which some of the leaders of these
parties have made to prevent themselves
being forgotten, and as protests
against the sweeping censure which
their indignant country has passed
upon them, have not been entirely free
of the ludicrous. But this makes no
difference. We are proud of a country
where opinion is thus free, and where
men have the manliness to speak
their opinions even when unpopular.
It is a noble privilege to our public
men, a corrective to the press, a benefit
to the community. While it exists, no
social or political disease is incurable,
and by such aids and renovating influences,
we trust, Great Britain is
yet destined to flourish and progress
for ages to come. The tyranny of the
multitude is as odious to England as
the oppression of a Czar; and as long
as this is the case, the noble inheritance
of British freedom is secure;
for we shall never react into an autocracy
until we have first suffered from
the still worse tyranny of the multitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>But politics furnish hardly a half
of that public oratory which nowadays
is ever welling forth, like springs
of thought, over the length and breadth
of the land. The other half belongs
in nearly equal proportions to Literature
and to practical and patriotic
Philanthropy. It is most gratifying
to see, as we so often do, the nobility
of Britain stepping from their baronial
halls to the rural meeting or the provincial
athenæum, there to advocate
the cause of moral and intellectual
improvement,—in words, it may sometimes
be, not overcharged with eloquence,
but still influential and productive
of much good from the position
and personal character of the
speakers. The place becomes hallowed
where good and kindly words
have been spoken; and these public
addresses have unquestionably contributed
with other causes to give a
higher tone to many convivial meetings
and social gatherings, formerly
remarkable for little else than deep
drinking and empty laughter. The
people still look up to our nobles as
their natural leaders, and they may
well do so,—for the great body of the
aristocracy comport themselves in a
manner worthy of their exalted station;
and we doubt not the recent
eulogium and prophecy of Count
Montalembert will prove well-founded,
that the nobles of England,
ever improving themselves, and still
keeping in the van, will continue to
rivet to themselves the respect and
regards of the British nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be confessed, however, that
our nobles and statesmen appear to
greater advantage when advocating
the cause of social elevation and moral
or sanitary reform, than in addresses
of a purely literary character. A good
man engaged in a good work disarms
criticism and attracts esteem; but
when the work essayed is purely
literary, the case is otherwise; and
in not a few instances addresses of
this kind, volunteered by men of
position in the country, have fallen
far short of the reputation or public
position of the speakers. For example,
it seems to us that the
dignity of statesmanship must suffer
an eclipse in public estimation,
when one who has played so important
a part in imperial politics as
Lord John Russell delivers himself
of a lecture so altogether trashy as
that which he lately pronounced in
Exeter Hall. It was a voluntary
performance made by his lordship to
keep himself before the public eye;
but he merely pilloried himself.
He has so long regarded himself as
the great champion of civil and religious
liberty in this country, and has
been so flattered by his followers, that
he has arrived at a condition in which
he is manifestly incapable of measuring
his own powers. In the course
of the last twelvemonth his lordship
has been in the Cabinet and out of
it—he has gone to negotiate at Vienna
and to lecture at Exeter Hall—he
tries everything, and fails in all. In
those stirring times, when public questions
of the most pressing moment
must be answered, and problems of
the most complicated kind require to
be solved, it was natural to expect
that a statesman of Lord John Russell’s
standing, if he did court a public
appearance, would at least grapple
with a question of the day; instead
of which, he treated his audience to
a piece of “antiquated imbecility,”—as
shallow in thought as it was
worthless in style,—wherein the “old
saws” were schoolboy commonplaces,
and the “modern instances” came no
nearer to us than the days of Galileo!
As a contemporary journal remarked,—“for
any sympathy of his readers,
or for any practical effect upon their
wills, he might as well have discoursed
to them of the patience of
Job or the justice of Aristides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such exceptions, however, ought
not to affect an estimate of the general
system or practice, which we
regard as fraught with much good.
It is observable that men of mark
who have special relations to any
place, to any town or district, frequently
seek to make their literary
or oratorical powers a graceful
means of cementing the connection
which subsists between them and
the place in question. It is to a
kindly desire of this kind that we
owe the lecture or address whose
title we have made a text for the
preceding remarks, and which we
desire to commend to the notice of
all address-givers as in many respects
a model of this class of compositions.
It is well considered,—a tribute of
respect to which every assembly is
entitled; the rare but fascinating
charm of style is felt throughout; and
its spirit is not more genial and sympathetic,
than its counsels are calculated
to be of deep practical influence
in the affairs of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>In choosing Labour for his theme,
Mr Warren addressed himself to a
subject which he knew must interest
every unit in the crowded audience
around him. The establishment of
the rights of labour is the first-fruit
of freedom, and the maintenance of
these rights is the first necessity of a
commonwealth. “Labour,” says Adam
Smith, “was the first price, the original
purchase-money that was paid
for all things. It was not by gold or
by silver, but <em>by labour</em>, that all the
wealth of the world was originally
purchased.” And, as that clear-sighted
writer adds, “the property
which every man has in his own
labour, as it is the original foundation
of all other property, so it is the
most sacred and inviolable. The
patrimony of a poor man lies in the
strength and dexterity of his hands;
and to hinder him from employing
his strength and dexterity in what
manner he thinks proper, without injury
to his neighbour, is a plain violation
of this most sacred property.
It is a manifest encroachment upon
the just liberty of both the workman,
and those who might be disposed
to employ him. As it hinders the
one from working at what he thinks
proper, so it hinders the others from
employing whom they think proper.”
“Labour,” almost simultaneously remarked
the great and good Turgot,
“is the <em>poor man’s property</em>: no property
is more sacred; and no time
nor authority can sanction the violation
of his right freely to dispose of
this, his only resource.” Words these,
as Mr Warren remarks, worthy to be
recorded in letters of gold. In Britain,
Labour, like Opinion, is <span class='fss'>FREE</span>.
And so profoundly cherished by our
nation is the principle of freedom in
labour, that even in our colonies we
have struck the fetters of bondage
from the Negroes, by an act, we will
not say prudent in the manner of its
accomplishment, but noble in the
highest degree from the spirit which
dictated it.</p>

<p class='c009'>But things were not always so in
England. In the early stages of
society everywhere, the only law is
the law of the strongest, and might
makes right. Even in the classic
States of Greece and Rome, where
civilisation of a certain kind reached
great eminence, the proportion of
free men to slaves was infinitesimal
only; and in Russia at the present
day, the vast majority of the
nation are still kept in a state of serfdom.
England too had a period—now
happily past by six or seven
centuries—when a similar state of
things prevailed. The working-classes
of England then groaned in
the state of slavery called villeinage,—a
<em>villein</em> being as absolutely the
property of his feudal lord as a dog
or a hog; unable to acquire any property
for himself, whatever he earned
belonging to his lord,—held to belong
to the land and sold with it,—torn at
will from his family,—his children
slaves like himself; and if a male
and female slave of different masters
married, their masters claimed any
children that might be born, who were
divided between them! The thirteenth
century had ended before any
considerable proportion of these villeins
had risen into the condition of
hired labourers. And the first time
we hear of these on a grand scale is
in the year 1348; on which occasion,
the great plague having terribly reduced
their numbers, the legislature
sternly interposed, “to deny the
poor,” in the indignant language of
Mr Hallam, “that transient amelioration
of their lot which the progress
of population, or other analogous
circumstances, would, without any
interference, very rapidly take away.”
“These poor creatures,” says Mr
Warren, “were naturally anxious to
be better paid for their labour, when
it had become so greatly increased in
value; and the legislature, in the
time of Edward III., passed acts
peremptorily fixing, with great precision,
the rates at which artisans
should be obliged to work, on pain of
punishment by fine and imprisonment.
This was the famous Statute
of Labourers, passed just five centuries
ago (1352), and which applied
exclusively to those whose means of
living was by the labour of their
hands—by the sweat of their brow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How different the case in England
now! What an advance have the
virtues of justice, mercy, and wisdom
made amongst us during these
last five centuries! Freedom, whether
personal or political, is no longer
an empty boast,—a privilege reserved
for a wealthy or high-born
minority. Its only limits are where
the liberty of the individual trenches
upon the liberty of his fellows,
or the good of the commonwealth.
As regards the rights of labour,
of which Mr Warren so ably treats,
a British labourer may work to any
master, for any number of hours
a-day he pleases, and may even contract
to work for a particular master
for his whole lifetime.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> But as regards
women and children the case
is different, and, acting not in accordance
with mere theory, but the dictates
of experience and philanthropy,
the British Legislature have found
it necessary to put restrictions upon
female and juvenile labour,—these
portions of the community being in
certain cases too weak and dependent
to look after their own interests.
In factory-works this is especially the
case. The mighty machinery in these
establishments requires simply to be
tended, so that a considerable portion
of the work can be done by mere
children. And hence it happens
that premature and improvident marriages
are frequent among the mill-workers,
who, instead of thinking of
supporting their children, look forward
to children as a means of supporting
themselves! A most cruel and
unnatural state of things, fatal to the
children, and pernicious to the community,
which thus witnesses within
its own bosom the growth of a class
utterly degenerate in body and totally
uneducated in mind. Acting upon
these considerations, the British Legislature
in 1833 passed the first
Factory Act, which bore in its preamble
“that it was necessary that
the hours of labour, of children and
young persons, employed in mills and
factories, should be regulated, inasmuch
as there are great numbers of
children and young persons now employed
in them, and their hours of
labour are longer than is desirable, due
regard being had to their health and
means of education.” By that statute
many excellent regulations were
made to mitigate the evil. And
again, in the years 1844, 1847, 1850,
and 1853, other acts were passed,
says Mr Warren, “further restricting
the hours of labour of women, young
persons, and children, in print-works,
mills, and factories; carefully providing
for their education, fixing the
time for beginning and ending work,
so as to prevent their toiling unnecessarily
and at unseasonable hours;
securing their holidays and periods
for recreation, fixing their meal-times;
providing for the cleanliness and
ventilation of the scenes of their
toil; guarding them as far as possible
against exposure to danger
from machinery; and subjecting
mills and factories to constant and
systematic inspection and regulation
by medical men and government
officers, whose business it is
to see that the benevolent care of
the Legislature is not defeated, or in
any way evaded. Again, no woman
or girl, of any age, and no boy under
the age of ten years, is now allowed
to work on any pretence whatever
in any mine or colliery; and no boy
can be apprenticed to such work
under that age, nor for more than
eight years. No young person under
twenty-one years of age is allowed to
enter any flue or chimney, either to
sweep it or extinguish fire; and no
boy under sixteen can be apprenticed
to a chimney sweeper; and even if
he be, the moment he wishes it, a
magistrate will discharge him from
his articles.” Such legislation, undeniably,
requires to be very prudently
proceeded with; for, while
taking care of the employed, we must
at the same time respect the freedom
of the employer, otherwise manufacturing
capital will flee our shores, and
the state of the working-classes will
be rendered worse than before.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question, indeed, at issue between
Labour and Capital is one of
exceeding difficulty, yet it is one
which every year is pressing itself
more urgently upon the consideration
of the country. The present laws
relating to this matter are unquestionably
a great improvement upon
what they were thirty years ago.
Down to the year 1824, two or
three working-men could not meet
together, though never so quietly,
to settle what wages they would
work for, and during what hours,
without committing an offence in the
eye of the law, and being punished
for it; while the masters, at the
same time, were at full liberty to
meet, and agree to give their men no
more than a particular sum! That
was neither freedom nor justice; and
the late Mr Hume only spoke the
truth when, stigmatising the principle,
he said,—“The law prevented
the labouring classes of the community
from combining together against
their employers, who, though few in
number, were powerful in wealth, and
might combine against <em>them</em>, and determine
not to give them more than
a certain sum for their labour. The
workmen could not, however, consult
together about the rate they ought to
fix on that labour, without rendering
themselves liable to fine and imprisonment,
and a thousand other inconveniences
which the law had reserved
for them.” This legal inequality
has been removed, but how
much remains to be done need be told
only to such as shut their eyes to the
ever-recurring strikes and misery
which desolate our manufacturing
districts. Labour is free,—and each
man wants to get as much for it as
he can; but unfortunately another
man as naturally wants to get it for as
little as he can. There is no love, no
sympathy, not even a common understanding
of each other’s affairs; each
party forms a league against the
other,—and so the heartless suicidal
strife goes on. Masters and men—it
is hard to say which party is the
more to blame. If improvidence on
the part of the work-people often
tempt them into, and aggravate their
position in strikes, by leaving them
no little surplus wherewith to meet
“hard times,”—turn to our last
month’s article on the Lancashire
strikes, and see if there be not also an
improvidence and gambling spirit on
the part of the master-manufacturers,
by which the wages and employment
of their men are needlessly placed
in jeopardy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Masters and men combine against
each other—that is the barbarous
order of the day. Men who fancy
that war with foreign nations can be
wholly abolished by means of arbitration,
yet wage an internecine contest
with their own brother-countrymen,—a
war which, so far from even
acknowledging the principle of arbitration,
is regularly carried on until one
or other of the parties sinks exhausted
in the combat! It is not long ago
since the combinations of the workmen
on strike were of the most savage
and atrocious character.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Of late they
have become less envenomed in spirit;
but still the tyranny which trades-unions
exercise over individual members
of the trade is as glaring as could
be practised by Governments even
the most despotic. The law attempts
to remedy this, but, alas! with little
effect. “If,” says the late Chief-Justice
Tindal, expounding the existing
statutes upon this point, “there be
one right, which beyond all others the
labourer ought to be able to call his
own, it is the right of the exertion of
his own personal strength and skill,
in the full enjoyment of his own free
will, altogether unshackled by the
control or dictates of his fellow-workmen;
yet strange to say, this very
right which the discontented workman
claims for himself to its fullest
extent, he does, by a blind perversity
and unaccountable selfishness, entirely
refuse to his fellows who differ in
opinion from himself! It is unnecessary
to say that a course of proceeding
so utterly unreasonable in
itself, so injurious to society, so detrimental
to the interests of trade,
and so oppressive against the rights
of the poor man, must be a gross and
flagrant violation of the law, and
when the guilt is established, must
be visited by a proper measure of
punishment.” But the masters also
may now be made to feel the restraining
power of the law; and at this
moment one of our highest tribunals,
a Court of Error, is occupied with a
question of no small importance and
difficulty, arising from an attempt of
eighteen Lancashire mill-owners to
enter into a counter-combination.
Their men having combined to support
each other in forcing their masters
to yield to their terms, the masters
entered into a bond to each other
not to open their mills for twelve
months, except on terms agreed to by
a majority; and the question was
brought before the Court of Queen’s
Bench, whether such an agreement
was or was not one in restraint of
trade, and consequently consistent or
inconsistent with the public good.
“The Court differed,” says Mr Warren;
“but the majority held that the
agreement was illegal, as unduly restraining
the freedom of trade, holding
‘that if particular masters might
thus combine, so might all the masters
in the kingdom:’ and, on the
other hand, all the men in the kingdom
might combine themselves into
a sort of Labour Parliament.” The
case, it is understood, will not be held
settled on either side until it has been
taken to the House of Lords, and
decided by the Court of last appeal
in the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principle or object kept in view
by the Legislature in framing the
present statutes seems to have been,
as Chief-Justice Tindal once observed,
“that if the workmen, on the one
hand, refused to work, or the master,
on the other, refused to employ, as
such a state of things could not continue
long, it might fairly be expected
that the party must ultimately give
way whose pretensions were not
founded on reason or justice—the
masters if they offered too little, the
workmen if they demanded too
much.” But, says Mr Warren, “this
leaves each party to decide on the
reason and justice of its pretensions,
and the unreasonableness and injustice
of those of its opponent. And it
is more likely that the Legislature
said to itself,—‘It will always be a
question of time; the weakest will
go to the wall first, though not till
after it has greatly hurt the stronger.’”
They just left each side to do its
worst, and worry or be worried to
death by its opponent, without the
State interfering so long as this work
of social murder went on <em>peaceably</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>Truly, this is sad work! And yet
legislation, we fear, though it may in
some degree curb, will never reach
the root of the evil. The only cure,
we feel persuaded, will be found in
social, not legislative reform. Better
information on the part of the working-classes
will do something to the
attainment of this most desirable
end; and Mr Warren, while paying a
just tribute to the “keen mother-wit
and right honest heart” of the
English working-classes, says,—</p>

<p class='c016'>“If many years’ observation and reflection
entitle me to make a recommendation,
it would be, that the working-classes
would find it of the highest value
to acquire, in a general way, as they could
with a little effort,—as by plain and good
lectures in this very place,—some knowledge
of the circumstances which determine
the rate of wages. That is a question,
in its higher and remoter branches,
of extreme difficulty; but its elementary
principles are pretty well agreed upon
now, and directly touch the only capital
of the poor man—his labour, and teach
him how to set a true and not a chimerical
and exaggerated value on it, at times
when the keenest dispute has arisen on
that very subject. Oh, what incalculable
benefits might arise from a knowledge,
by the acute working-classes, of the
leading principles agreed upon by great
thinkers, statesmen, and economists of
every hue of opinion, as those regulating
the relation between employers and employed,
and establishing, not a conflict of
interest, but an absolute identity!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet it is not Ignorance, but Selfishness—that
passion the most abiding
of our nature—that is the prime
mover in these dire contests between
the employers and employed; and
along with every effort for the education
of our working-classes, we should
strive also still more assiduously to
cultivate their moral nature and make
mutual charity and forbearance more
prevalent both among high and low.
Very beautifully, and no less wisely
and earnestly, does Mr Warren speak
on this subject. Inculcating forbearance
between master and man in hard-times,
he says:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Each ought honestly to place himself,
for a moment, in the other’s situation—when
each might see causes in
operation which he might not otherwise
have seen—trials and difficulties of which
he had not dreamed. Let the master
look steadily at the position of the working
man, especially in hard times, pressed
down to the earth with exhausting
labour, anxiety, and galling privations
endured by himself and his family, often
almost maddening him, as he feels that
it <em>is in vain for him to rise up early, to sit
up late, to eat the bread of sorrow</em>: in
moments of despondency and despair,
he feels as though the appalling language
of the prophet were sounding in his
ears—<em>Son of man, eat thy bread with
quaking, and drink thy water with trembling
and with carefulness!</em> He cannot
keep himself and those towards whom
his harassed heart yearns so tenderly
from the jaws of starvation, with all his
patience, economy, and sobriety; and
yet he sees out of the fruit of his
labours, his employers <em>apparently</em> rolling
in riches, and revelling in luxury and
splendour! But let that workman, on
the other hand, do as he would be done
by: let his master deal with his capital,
which happens to be money, as the
workman with his, which happens to be
labour—‘freely.’ Let him reflect on the
anxieties and dangers to which his employer
is often exposed, but dare not explain,
or make them public, lest it
should injure or ruin his credit: his
capital may be locked up in machinery,
or he may be otherwise unable to realise
it, however desperate his emergency,
without a destructive sacrifice: great
but perfectly legitimate speculation
may have failed from causes he could
not foresee or control—from accident,
from fraud, or misfortune of others—from
a capricious change in public
taste: he may have been running
desperately, but with an honest spirit,
along the black line of bankruptcy for
many months, without his workmen
dreaming of it, and yet has punctually
paid their weekly wages to perhaps several
or many hundreds of them, often borrowing
at heavy interest to do so, while
these workmen supposed him always the
master of untold thousands! Now I say,
let each party try to think of all these
things, and pause before he commits
himself to a rash and ruinous line of
hostility. A strike too often partakes of
the nature of a social suicide. Capital—that
is, labour and money—at war with
itself, may be compared to the madman
who, in a sudden phrenzy, dashes each
of his fists against the other, till both
are bleeding and disabled—perhaps for
ever.... Let each party sincerely
try to respect the other; to find out and
dwell on those qualities really, and to so
large an extent, entitling each to the
other’s respect and sympathy. Let the
master reflect on the patience, ay the
truly heroic patience, self-denial, fortitude,
and energy with which the workman
endures severe trials and privations;
and let the workman reflect on the fairness
and moderation, often under circumstances
of serious difficulty,—on the
generosity and munificence of his master,
as could be testified by tens of thousands
of grateful workmen, in seasons of sickness,
suffering, and bereavement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Towards the close of his elaborate
lecture, Mr Warren discourses nobly
and cheerfully on the Dignity and
Consolations of labour, and glances
at the monster evils of Improvidence
and Intemperance by which the daily
life of the working-classes is robbed
alike of its honour and its comfort. In
this part occurs a passage so striking
and so eloquent that we cannot but
transfer it to our pages, and we trust
the warning and appeal which it conveys
will animate all who have the
privilege of influencing the working-classes,
with an enduring desire to
banish the debasing and all-abstracting
passion of intemperance from
their ranks.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I hope and believe that I <em>must</em> go out
of this hall, to find a victim of <em>Intemperance</em>!
Such a man, or rather wreck of
a man, is not to be found <em>here</em>! I know,
however, where to find him; there is
another hall in which I took my seat
this morning, have sate all day, and shall
be at my gloomy post again in the morning,
to see,—possibly,—standing trembling,
or sullen and desperate at the bar
of justice, one whom the untiring and
remorseless fiend Intemperance has
dragged thither, and stands grim but
unseen beside his victim. He had been
a man, might we say, well to do in the
world, and getting respected by all his
neighbours, till <em>he took to drink</em>, and then
it was all up with him—and there he
stands! disgraced, and in despair. I
need not draw on my imagination for
illustrations, especially before an audience
which numbers so many men whose
painful duty as jurymen it is to sit every
sessions, with myself, engaged in the
administration of justice. You have seen
how often, in a moment of voluntary
madness occasioned by drink, a life’s
character has been sacrificed, the brand
of felon impressed on the brow, and
free labour exchanged for that which is
profitless, compulsory, and ignominious
to the workman, within the walls of your
prison! It would be unjust, however,
not to say that exhausting labour, and
the companionship of those who are together
so exhausted, supply but too
many temptations to seek the refreshment
and exhilaration afforded by liquor,
and which soon degenerates, from an
occasional enjoyment, into an accursed
habit. Home soon ceases to be home,
to him who returns to it under the guilty
delirium of intoxication: there, weeping
and starving wife and children appear
like dismal spectres flitting before his
bloodshot eye and reeling brain. As
the husband frequents the dramshop,
so he drives his wretched wife the oftener
to the pawn-shop, and her and his
children at length to the workhouse; or
perhaps in her desperation—but I dare
not proceed! The coroner can tell the
rest.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Look at yonder desolate little room,
at the end of a dreary court; a funeral
goes out from it in the morning! Enter
this evening. All is silent, and a single
candle on the mantel-piece sheds a dull
flickering light on a coffin, not yet
screwed down. Beside it sits morally a
murderer; his bloated face is hid in his
shaking hands; he has not yet ventured
to move aside the coffin lid, but at length
he dares to look at his poor victim—his
broken-hearted wife! Poor, poor soul!
thou art gone at last! Gone, <em>where
the wicked cease from troubling, and the
weary are at rest</em>! ’Tis a happy release,
say the friendly neighbours, who have
contributed their little means to lay her
decently in her coffin. Ay, besotted
husband! let your bloodshot eyes look
on that white face, that wreck of a face
so sweet and pretty when you married
her! Never fear! the eyes are closed,
and will weep and look mournfully at
you no more! Touch, if you dare, those
limbs, which the woman who laid them
out said, with a sigh, were <em>mere skin and
bone</em>! Dare you take hold of her cold
hand and look at her wedding-ring? Do
you see how her finger is worn with the
needle? During the day, during the
night, this poor creature was your willing
slave, mending your linen, and that
of your wronged children, and what was
left of her own, and which are nearly
rags. Do you hear those children sobbing
in the next room? Do you see the
scar on that cheek? Look and tremble.
Have you forgotten the blow that caused
it, given by your hand of drunken and
ruffian violence? Yet she never reproached
you! And when at length,
worn away with misery, starvation, and
ill-usage, she was forced to give up the
struggle for life, her last—her very last
act was gently and in silence to squeeze
your unworthy hand! Perhaps remorse
is now shaking your heart, and you inwardly
groan—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, if she would but come again,</div>
      <div class='line'>I think I’d grieve her so no more!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>She will come no more on earth, but you
will have to meet her again! So, man,
close the coffin lid! Go to bed, and
sleep if you can! The funeral is in the
morning, and you must follow the poor
emaciated body close past your favourite
dramshop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As befitted the audience, it is
manual or mechanical labour that
Mr Warren in his essay chiefly concerns
himself with. But so eminent
an author cannot be insensible to the
still nobler labour of the Mind, or to
the grand and touching lives of so
many of its votaries. Manual labour
may appear harder than some kinds
of intellectual pursuits, but it cannot
be carried to the same excess. It is
less fatal, because less alluring. The
labour of the hands does not kill like
the labour of the head. It is not the
lower classes alone that work. Mr
Warren well says:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The <em>working-classes</em>! Are those not
worthy of the name, and in its very highest
sense, few in number, comparatively,
though they be, who by their prodigious
powers of thought make those discoveries
in science which have given tenfold
efficacy and value to labour, turned it
suddenly into a thousand new channels,
and conferred on all classes of society
new conveniences and enjoyments? Are
we to overlook those great intellects
which have devoted themselves to statesmanship,
to jurisprudence, to morals, to
the science of medicine—securing and
advancing the best interests of mankind,
and relieving them from physical anguish
and misery; the noble genius devoted
to literature, refining, expanding,
and elevating the minds of all capable of
it, and whose immortal works are glittering
like stars of the first magnitude
in the hemisphere of thought and imagination?
No, my friends; let us not be
so unjust, ungrateful, or unthinking; let
us rather be thankful to God for giving
us men of such powers, and opportunity
and inclination to use them, not for their
own reputation’s sake alone, but for our
advantage; and let us not enhance the
claims of manual, by forgetting or depreciating
intellectual labour. I could at
this moment give you a dozen instances
within my personal knowledge, of men
whom God has given very little physical
strength, but great mental endowments,
and who cheerfully undergo an amount
of exhausting labour of which you have
no idea, in conducting public affairs, political
and legal, and prosecuting scientific
researches, immortalising the age in
which they live.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genius in all ages commands the
spontaneous homage of mankind.
And it is only just that it should be
so. “Tell me,” said an acute observer
of human affairs, “what a few
leading minds are thinking in their
closets, and I will tell you what their
countrymen will be thinking in the
next generation.” It is the great
minds of a country that most deeply
influence its fortunes,—it is the great
minds of the world that mould the
progress of our race. These men
may live a life of toil and sacrifices
in the cause to which their high
powers are devoted, and may die
ere the precious seed sown by them
has begun to germinate. But they
do not lose their reward. The fruit
comes at last. Their words enlighten
the world, hastening its progress to
a happy goal; while their example
of high powers and glorious self-devotion
reaps a rich recompense by
inspiriting others through future ages
to follow in their steps. As saith
Longfellow,—</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>TOUCHING OXFORD.<br> <span class='small'>A LETTER TO PROFESSOR NEBEL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>My dear Professor!—You see
that I have not forgotten the note of
admiration which your countrymen
use at the beginning of letters when
they address each other. It is an
easy way of giving emphasis to the
greeting, or of expressing the admiration
of the writer for the character
of the person written to. When I
last saw you at Dummerjungenberg,
I recollect I promised to write you
down the impressions which an intended
visit to my old University
might make upon me, and I hasten
to fulfil that promise now. It is superfluous
for me to tell you that the
two English universities are essentially
different in their constitution
from a German university, as you
are well acquainted theoretically
with the constitutions of both. I
maintain that each kind is good, and
answers its own end. The German
university fully answers its purpose
of making men learned, but the
stamp of character which it affixes
to the man is evanescent, and does
not follow him through life. According
to the language of the Bursch
or German student, as soon as a man
has ceased to be a student, he falls
back again, as a matter of course,
into the Philisterium, or limbo of
the Philistines, which is the student’s
term to designate the uncovenanted
class, which comprises all mankind
excepting the student. On the other
hand, we speak of men for the whole
of life as Oxford or Cambridge men
much more than we do of them as
Göttingen or Leipzig men, inferring
by this mode of expression that
they have been, as it were, fed on
the milk of Alma Mater, which continues
through the whole of life to
affect their constitutions in a peculiar
manner. So highly do some of
our men think of this influence, that
they dread too much infusion of the
Germanic element, as dangerous to
this peculiar quality of our universities
of forming and stamping the
whole man, instead of merely the
logical part of him. I recollect well
that at a meeting of Convocation at
Oxford, when some material changes
were brought under consideration,
no sentiment was more highly applauded
than one which concluded
the Latin speech of a talented polemical
churchman, when he said,
“Hanc Universitatem Germanizari
non volo”—“I protest against this
university being Germanised;”—by
which he plainly meant, not that he
objected to the widening of its scope
of teaching, but that he feared that
mere instruction would usurp too
much prominence in the scheme of
education, and throw into the shade
that general moral training which is
now a most essential part of the
system. One of the feelings, to
speak individually, that I should
be sorry to lose is that which this
very name of Alma Mater implies.
The word “Almus” is one of the
most beautiful in the Latin language;
it means that whose nature is to
cherish, nourish, inspire with life.
Thus, Venus is called “Alma” by the
ancients, as representing the principle
of life in nature; Ceres is also
called “Alma,” as being the goddess
that supplies the staff of life. If it
be true, as Mr Carlyle says, that our
word “lady” is derived from two old
words, meaning a giver of loaves, it
would be a good translation of the
word “Alma.” And desirable it
certainly is, that the word “lady”
should bear this fulness of meaning;
the function of woman, in her beautiful
ideal, being to give life, to support
life, and to make life worth
living. And the poet saw the matter
truly, as poets generally do the most
truly, when he said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Woman, dear woman, in whose name,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wife, sister, mother meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine is the heart by earliest claim,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thine its latest beat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Now, to every Oxford man, his Lady
Mother, or Alma Mater, in the transcendental
sense, is his university,
occupying nearly as high a place in
his heart as Our Lady occupies in
that of the devout Catholic. And this
much I can say from experience. As
Hercules could do nothing in wrestling
against the giant Antæus, the
son of the Earth, as long as he persisted
in throwing him, seeing that
whenever he fell in his mother’s lap
he gained new strength, so is it with
myself; the world never throws me,—I
never am cast down by circumstances,
but a thrill from the warm bosom of
Alma Mater, as powerful but more
enduring than galvanism, inspires
me with a new life, and I rise with
fresh courage and fresh heart to the
wrestling-match of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have lately visited my old University
after a long absence, and found its
outward aspect fair as ever—nay,
rather fairer and fresher than ever.
Changed it is undoubtedly, but
changed for the better. Much that is
new and tasteful, at the same time—a
rare accident in our times—has
been added, and the hand of Time has
been arrested, and that which was
decayed or destroyed has been restored
with affectionate fidelity. One
of the greatest improvements, to my
mind, has been effected by the railroad,
which was at first greatly
feared as a revolutionary agent. It
has diverted from the main thoroughfares
that brawling stream of traffic
which formerly flowed through them
in the shape of stage-coaches, stage-waggons,
and other properties and
accessories of the stage, and left the
town to its genuine academical character
of a dignified repose. Although
this change gives to the town, in
the eyes of commercial travellers,
a somewhat dead-alive appearance,
and although a similar change in
other places seems to take away truly
the only life they possessed, it seems,
on the contrary, to have withdrawn
an unpleasant intrusion from Oxford,
and left her to the dignified
retirement from the world of bustle
and action, in which she most delights.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oxford is a town which, for its
medieval beauty, deserves to be kept
under a glass-case; and nothing can
be more advantageous to its academical
character, than diverting
from its walls the turbid current of
commerce which belongs to this
much-bepraised nineteenth century.
This the railroad has achieved most
effectually. There is still abundance
of life in the streets, but life in unison
with the history of the place; and
suddenly whirled as one is by the
express train from the turmoil of
London to the repose of Oxford, with
its lines of venerable colleges, and
troops of sombre but graceful gowned
figures, one experiences a feeling as
of having been transported in a trance
on the carpet of the Arabian Nights
from one place to another. Never
did the High Street appear so broad
or so beautiful as now that its area
is uninvaded by the rattle of vulgar
vehicles. The time to see it to perfection
is when the sun happens to
set behind the opening at Carfax
Church, dazzling the eye at its focus,
and forcing shafts of amber light
out along the fronts of St Mary’s and
All Saint’s churches, and the fantastic
façade of Queen’s College. This
is a condition which presents one of
the finest town-views in the world
that can be seen where there are no
mountains in the case. There is
much similarity between Oxford and
the grand old Flemish towns; and the
railway has been a boon to them, as
it has been to her, in preserving their
quiet character. Unlike other English
towns, the inhabitants of which
point with an ignorant pride to the
substitution of stucco-fronted houses,
and cockney plate-glass, for the cross-beamed
gables and lattices, all the
architectural changes which have
taken place of late years in Oxford
appear to have been for the better.
One is certainly sorry to see the
time-corroded and weather-beaten
stone disappearing from the faces of
the colleges, and new freestone appearing
in its place; but this change,
though one that we may sigh over
as even over the seasonal changes
of nature, is, in reality, of a conservative
character, and its absolute necessity
is an unanswerable plea. The
nature of the stone of which most of
the colleges are built being such as
to peculiarly expose it to wear and
tear of weather, we are not sorry to
see it replaced by a material which
looks durable in its novelty, and to
many generations yet to come will
become more beautiful with age. No
expense has been spared in these reparations;
and the stranger will be
peculiarly struck with the manner
in which they have been carried out
in many of the principal buildings.
In Oxford alone, of all the towns in
England, domestic architecture appears
properly subordinate to that
devoted to public purposes; and as
she grows in beauty with each addition,
her inhabitants may be one
day allowed to boast as the Romans
of the olden time,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Privatus illis census erat brevis,</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span lang="la">Commune magnum</span>,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>for the splendour of her public buildings
will quickly dwarf the most
ambitious attempts of private proprietors;
and one good result of the
communal, or, as a Cantab would
rather say, combinational life of Oxford,
is the prospect that things will
be achieved there by bodies of men
imbued with the “genius loci,” which
would surpass the aspiration, taste,
or indeed ability of most individuals
to accomplish elsewhere. So should
it ever be. What can the use be of
any individual, whose establishment
does not assume palatial proportions,
pluming himself on the possession
of architectural decorations, or
masterpieces of painting or sculpture,
which, added to a public gallery,
would give delight and instruction
to thousands, instead of administering
to the pleasures of a few? I do
not know whether you have ever
visited Oxford. If you have, I may
remind you, though unnecessarily,
that, besides the world-renowned
High Street, there are two other
streets in it not less characteristic—one
the Broad Street, parallel with it
for a part of its length; and the other
St Giles’s, a continuation of the Corn
Market, running at right angles to
the High Street from Oxford Cross.
The Broad Street is one of those areas
reminding us of Continental cities,
where the population might be mustered
in arms if necessary. It was in
the middle of this that Cranmer,
Ridley, and Latimer were martyred;
and at its junction with St Giles’s is
now set up an elegant Gothic monument,
something in the manner of Sir
Walter Scott’s at Edinburgh, to perpetuate
the memory of that event.
St Giles’s is a most remarkable street.
It has a church at its commencement
and near its end, where it branches
into two roads. It is so spacious
that the houses on each side, irregularly
built as they are, and ought to
be, appear diminutive; and between
the houses and the central road, on
each side, is a row of trees, which
gives it the appearance of a boulevard.
On entering it, you have on the right
the new buildings of Baliol, and farther
on, the more ancient face of St
John’s College; facing which are the
new Taylor Buildings—a structure
with which much fault has been
found, as a weak centre on the side
towards Beaumont Street appears to
carry two heavy wings, but which
must be allowed on all hands to conduce
greatly to the adorning of its
site, and indeed of the town generally.
It is in this street that fountains,
judiciously placed, would add much
to the general effect; but many may
doubt whether fountains would ever
have other than an unnatural and
artificial aspect in England, where
the wetness of the atmosphere renders
drier objects pleasanter to look
upon. There are two seasons of the
year when fountains are especially
agreeable—in the summer heats, when
it is delightful to be within reach of
their spray; and in frost, when they
are draped with pendulous icicles of
the most fantastic beauty—a phenomenon
I have indeed seen on the
little fountain in the Botanic Garden
at Oxford. Both these seasons are
generally with us of short duration,
and during all the rest, fountains to
many would be somewhat of an eyesore,
and create a shivering sensation.
Those in Trafalgar Square count as
nothing. As for the Crystal Palace
and Versailles fountains, and all of
the same description, people delight
in them more for their mechanical
cleverness than their artistic effect,
and they are things got up for holiday
occasions, not meant to form
parts of the scenes of everyday life,
like the fountains of Italy, or the
gossip-haunted Brunnen of Germany.
I fear then that, for the present, Oxford
must be contented with her
rivers, and not babble of fountains.
She is one of the few large towns singularly
blest with the presence of
ever-flowing and ever-living water.
The Isis runs beside her, covered
with a fleet of pleasure-boats, probably
as large as that of Athens during
the Peloponnesian war, to which it
has been wittily compared, and in the
summer days, swarming in and out
amongst each other like the gondolas
of Venice. The Cherwell, which is a
river as large as the famed Cam, or
nearly so, encircles the meadows of
Christchurch and Magdalen, and,
with its sinuous course, and banks
overshadowed with trees, presents
numberless nooks of beauty, and
spots of refuge from the heats of summer.
The avenue in Christchurch
meadow is second to none in the
world, perhaps superior to all, though
there are many like it; for instance,
the avenue at Cambridge, which was
compared by Porson to a college fellowship,
as a long dreary vista with
a church at the end of it; the avenue
by the Severn, in the Quarries at
Shrewsbury: that of the University
of Bonn, and others at royal residences,
and near places of academic retirement.
In connection with this
avenue, it is well to mention that
there is a time-honoured custom prevalent
in the University, of making
it a general promenade on the Sunday
in Commemoration-week, which
generally occurs towards the end of
the leafy month of June. On that
day, most of the members of the University
are to be seen in their distinctive
dresses; and those are considered
happy who are accompanied
with friends, called, from their object
in visiting the University, “lions and
lionesses;” nor is the wealth and
beauty of the city unrepresented.
From this custom arises the name of
“Show Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rivers afford an inexhaustible
source of amusement, at a cheap and
easy rate, to the gownsmen, who
luxuriate in all sorts of boats, according
to their activity or laziness—the
energetic eight-oar, the social four-oar,
the friendly pair-oar, the fantastic
canoe, the adventurous outrigger-skiff,
the dreamy sailing-boat, and
the sleepy punt, the latter having
come into fashion chiefly of late years,
and in the hot season, and being a
method of amusement which, at the
price of the violent exertion of one
of the party, purchases the perfect
repose of the rest, who lie on their
backs in boating-dresses, cigar in
mouth, and the last work of Dickens
or Thackeray, chosen for its lightness,
in hand, and watch over the sides
the swimmings of their Skye terriers.
This peculiar dog, distinguished from
all others by its sagacity, fidelity, and
an ugliness which has worn into
beauty, is now quite a part of the University
system; yet I remember when
the first was introduced into Oxford,
and considered so remarkable that
he gave his master the name among
the townsmen of the “gentleman
what belongs to the dog.” The poor
little fellow had to suffer much for
his resemblance to a door-mat, before
his position was fully recognised.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next in importance to the colleges
and rivers of Oxford are the gardens.
With the latter we must include
the college-meadows, which are composed
of a real meadow in the
centre, surrounded by a planted
gravel-walk, bounded generally, on
the outer side, by one of the rivers.
These gardens, though private, are
liberally opened by the college
authorities to the public, and, occupying
a large part of the area of
the town, they invite the residents
to a number of short walks and
lounges, the temptation to which in
other towns is generally wanting,
but which must be most conducive
to health. In some of them—as in
St John’s—the members of the college
amuse themselves with archery,
in others with bowls—a truly after-dinner
recreation; while in the park
that is attached to the grounds of
Magdalen College the eye is gladdened
by the sight of a number of
browsing deer, who become singularly
tame in consequence of the
attentions of the Fellows. Well
might Macaulay call it “their pleasant
abode” of Magdalen! Magdalen
is now rendered even more pleasant
to some minds by the choral service
of the Church of England having
been brought to perfection in its
chapel, so that its members can
never attend Divine service without
their ears being charmed by the
most exquisite music. Others may
be of opinion that the service
solemnly read produces an effect
which is appreciable by all rather
than by a few of peculiar temperament.
I do not take upon myself
to strike the balance. In two other
colleges is the service sung instead
of being said—namely, in St John’s
and New Colleges, and these three
colleges are naturally a source of
great attraction to strangers—so
much so, that the chapels being
of limited dimensions, admission
to them has of necessity been
made a favour. In the chapels at
Oxford, customs have been perpetuated
from time immemorial,
which would shock rigid Protestantism,
unless inured to them
by habitual contact—such as the
lighting of candles on the altar, and
painted altar-pieces, instead of the
Commandments-table which is usual
in Anglican churches. Be this as it
may, the attendance at morning
chapel, which is enforced on the
junior members, and sometimes considered
by them a grievance, becomes
in time so much a habit that they
feel the want of it when they
become parochial clergymen, and in
many cases endeavour to perpetuate
it by daily services (having certainly
the letter of the law of their Church
on their side), with considerable
success indeed in some town parishes,
and among the richer classes; but
with doubtful result in the rural districts,
where the peculiar habits of
the labouring poor scarcely seem to
allow them to fall in with it to any
great extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>While on the subject of Oxford, you
naturally wish me to say what I think
generally of the system of education
of the place. I will tell you, then,
in short, that I consider it the best
possible system of education to form
the character of a man and a gentleman.
Do you ask me why? I
answer that it is so for this simple
reason—that it tends to develop in
the fairest manner all the various
energies of that many-sided creature,
Man. There are two sorts of education
at Oxford, as at our public
schools—one enforced by law, the
other dependent on social customs:
both have their full sway at Oxford.
Thus we have a practical illustration
of the strongest kind of the Platonic
theory of education. Plato very
properly thought that the development
of the bodily powers was
almost of as much consequence as
that of the mental, and accordingly
enjoined that education in his Utopia
should consist of music and gymnastics.
By music he understood all
that falls into the province of either
of the nine Muses. By gymnastics
he understood not a dreary tugging
at ropes, and hugging of bars, and
climbing ladders with hands, but a
simultaneous exercise of mind and
body in pastimes where the body is
deceived by the mind into activity,
and cheated into wholesome weariness—such
as contests of strength
and passages of arms, hunting, fowling,
and the like. Even so at Oxford
physical education is complete; and
although it does not form a subject
of examination in the schools under
the new system, it is carried perhaps
to greater perfection than any other
kind, and therefore we may conclude
that the Royal Commission does
well to leave it where it stands.
These Oxford gymnastics (using the
word always in its special and
Platonic sense) are for the greater
part perfectly consistent with the
“musical” part of the system which
emanates from authority. Occasionally,
however, those sports, which,
as a Catholic founder of one of the
colleges said, “miram atque incredibilem
delectationem afferunt” (showing
that the old boy himself, though
he wished to see his seminary like
a bee-hive, thoroughly appreciated
them), interfere with the hours devoted
to study; and therefore fox-hunting,
which I especially allude to,
is generally discouraged by the Dons
even in the case of those students
who are able to afford it. The delicious
languor, so unlike the rude
and partial fatigue resulting from
any other exercise, which pervades
the whole system after a good day’s
riding, and gives a Parisian savour
to the plainest dinner, is of course
fatal for the rest of the day to
any other intellectual work; for
who shall deny that hunting is
intellectual work?—intellectual for
the hounds, who have the sagest
of beasts to outwit—intellectual
for the horses, who have the safest
footing to choose in a moment of
time, and the exactest distances to
measure; intellectual for the rider,
who requires the eye of an eagle and
the judgment of a Solon to know
where he ought to be, not to mention
the huntsman and M. H., whose
whole lives, if they take deep interest
in the matter, as they generally do,
must be spent in intense thought?
An excellent exercise it is of mind,
undoubtedly, but fatal to other exercises
of a less absorbing character,
and therefore consistently discouraged
by the Dons. The same may be said
of driving. Driving is at best but a
lazy exercise; and though it requires
skill, it is not sufficiently gymnastic;
besides, it is expensive, and presents
no advantage corresponding to the
expense. But we cannot help thinking
that if the thunders of each university
Zeus had been less lavishly
launched against tandem-driving in
particular, this antiquated practice,
very good in peculiar countries, but
generally merely a puppyish display,
would have died out of itself. There
is always a peculiar sweetness to
young minds in forbidden pleasures.</p>

<p class='c009'>But boating and cricket and football,
tennis, rackets, fives, and billiards,
still please, although there is nothing
illegitimate about them, and are perfectly
consistent with the earnest
pursuits of the place. With regard
to billiards, I must just observe that
this fascinating game has in a great
measure lost its reputation, from the
fact that the billiard-room is in most
English towns the rendezvous of all
the blackguardism of the place; but
in Oxford the billiard-rooms are private,
and engaged by each party of
players; they are an especial refuge
on wet days, nor can I see any exception
that can be taken to the pastime,
save when it degenerates into the
public pool, becomes a species of
gambling, and loses its real character,
which is that of a game of skill, quite
as much as that of chess, combined
with gentle exercise. As there is not
the slightest danger of the studies I
have mentioned falling into desuetude,
so have they been with good
judgment overlooked by the University
authorities, and as they present
in every phase an examination of
themselves, it has not been found
necessary to create any special honours
as a reward for proficiency in them.
The universal existence of this gymnastic
education in Oxford, superadded
to a peculiar keenness and
dampness in the air, induces an appetite
which can only be satisfied by
what appears to strangers an unusual
amount of eating and drinking. In
the latter particular there is indeed a
great improvement. Excess in quantity
is extremely rare even among
extravagant students; but the fiery
wines of Portugal and Spain still hold
their ground against all comers, and
public opinion is decidedly in their
favour—so much so, that others are
treated with a sort of contempt. It
is said that on the occasion of the
visit of a great personage to the sister
University, whose habits bear a
strong resemblance to those of Oxford,
when the servants of that personage
sent a complaint to the entertainer,—a
Head of a House,—that
they were only supplied with port
when they were used to claret, he
sent back a message to them that the
college port, with a due admixture of
pump-water, would make the best
claret in the world. The substantial
nature of an Oxford breakfast, enough
of itself to convert Bishop Berkeley
to a belief in the existence of Matter,
is in itself an evidence that the potations
of the preceding night have seldom
been immoderate. With regard to
that part of the education of the place,
to the furtherance of which its gymnastics
and good fare are supposed only
to administer, it is truly “musical”
in the Greek sense of the word. Of
music, as we understand it, there is
certainly little as yet enjoined; but
every encouragement is given to its
culture by chanted services in certain
chapels, by a liberal allowance of
concerts sanctioned by authority, by
doctor’s degrees conferred in it, with
a most splendid gown worthy of
Apollo himself if he ever wore one;
by especially the Grand Commemoration
festival, at which the first public
singers are often engaged. On
the whole, there is a great taste in
Oxford for this beautiful art, which
requires little forcing, for it grows of
itself in the climate of the place. This
taste is especially shown by the liberality
with which brass-bands playing
your national airs are remunerated;
but important as it is, it is sometimes
found to interfere with the soundless
but sounder elements of education,
and therefore it becomes necessary in
certain cases to check it. The rooms
of the men have in general such thin
partitions, that the noise of one seriously
interferes with the silence of
another. I once knew a reading man
in —— College, who was placed between
two pianofortes, one overhead,
and the other underfoot: he especially
complained of the interruption on
Sundays, as on that day his more
celestial neighbour played sacred
tunes, while his neighbour of the
nether world played profane, producing
a discord in mid-air as ludicrous
as painful to an ear of taste. But I
take it that the sense in which music
is used in old scholastic Latin, is in
general the Platonic sense, and thus
the Music school at Oxford means
one not especially devoted to exercises
in what we call music, but to
exercises on examination in belles
lettres. That this term has acquired
a broader significance by the recent
changes in the Oxford University
system, I cannot but think a subject
for congratulation. When the University
departed as a general principle
from the practice of making
verse-writing in the dead languages
the mainspring of erudition in them—a
practice still far from obsolete in
the public schools of England—it became
necessary, if only to take up the
time of the students, and prevent them
from lapsing into intellectual inanition,
to supply them with other food
congenial to the spirit of the place.
The germ of these new studies had
existed before, and only required development.
There could be no better
foundation for culture in modern
history and jurisprudence than the
exact study of the ancient historians
of Greece and Rome pursued under
the old system. Even so with mathematics.
The modern examinations
are, for the most part, mere distributions
of the former work, and by getting
part of it over sooner, the student
is less puzzled as to the disposal of his
time. But the paucity of candidates
for mathematical honours, in comparison
with those who cling to belles
lettres, is a sign that the exact
sciences are still exotics in the atmosphere
of Oxford; and as long as the
spirit of the place remains what it is,
they are scarcely likely to become
otherwise. Nor are the physical
sciences apparently likely to acquire
soon a hold on the popular feeling of
the University. Still, as before, the
pivot around which Oxford studies revolve
is formed by the solid metal of
the ancient classical authors, whose
words are picturesque and statuesque,
and fraught with the same eternal
beauty, the same adaptability as
models for all time, as the things that
the hands of their contemporaries produced.
Although as yet no school of
modern languages has been formed in
which examination in them forms a
part of the University system, yet
every encouragement has been given
to the study of them by the foundation
of a professorship supported by public
teacherships; and even if nothing
more is done, there is every reason
to think that, supported as it is by
the cosmopolitan position which our
country has taken of late years, this
important branch of literature will
sufficiently nourish in Oxford.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far it appears that the changes
which have been made in the constitution
of Oxford have been of a conservative
character—the reforms have
destroyed nothing, but developed a
great deal that formerly lay dormant
in the University system. They will
continue to be of this character if
the University is allowed abundance
of light and air and space to put
forth its own energies, and not damaged
by injudicious meddling from
without. There have been rumours
of further changes, some of which
are apparently called for by the necessities
of the time, while others
have merely been engendered by the
inventiveness of the spirit of innovation.
One peculiarly delicate subject
has been brought on the tapis,
which, although I hold an opinion
of my own respecting it, I should prefer
stating in the position of one
balancing two conflicting views, as
far as my prejudice admits. I mean
the celibacy of the Fellows. In the
first place, if it is true that women
are like a church, because there is no
<em>living</em> without them, a proposition I
heard the other day in the form of a
riddle, the business is settled at once,
because it is cruelty to condemn any
body of men to a living grave; but,
on the other hand, if the men themselves
acquiesce in this social burial,
and refuse to be delivered from it,
they have undeniably a voice in the
matter, even though it be from the
catacombs, and ought to be heard in
a manner so nearly and dearly affecting
their own interests. The defenders
of the present system have a
great advantage in being able to
raise a laugh against those who from
within advocate a change, alleging
that they have some gentle reasons
for doing so. We are a nation peculiarly
sensitive to being placed in
a ridiculous position, and it requires
no small amount of moral courage
for any man who is a member of a
body to start opinions which the
rest, though they may in their hearts
sympathise with, are not immediately
prepared to fall in with. It
must be allowed that the outcry
against collegiate celibacy has been
louder outside than inside the walls
of common rooms. It may be said,
on the other side, that the voices of
those without are not stifled by the
fear of snubbing and ridicule as
those within are, and that those who
see the effect of a system on others
are better qualified to judge than
those whose own minds are biassed
by its pressure. Those who work in
mines and live in unwholesome air
only feel by diminished energy the
evil effects of the miasma they have
to breathe, while those who live
apart from them see it in their pale
and haggard looks. It is not the
bondsman in general who calls for
emancipation so loudly as the spectator
who has tasted the sweets of
freedom. To come to a practical
aspect of the question; it is urged by
the advocates of emancipation that
celibacy was part of the religious
system under which the colleges were
founded, and that as that religious
system has ceased to exist in reference
to them, there is no object in
keeping up a restriction which can
have no such motive; and to those
who would urge that the intentions of
the founders ought to be consulted
as that of any testator ought to be,
it is answered that it is hypocrisy to
pretend to consult the wills of founders
in a matter which is merely a
corollary to a rule which has been
essentially broken through, and that
the wills of founders are even in this
instance nullified by the marriage of
heads of colleges, who being of necessity
priests by the statutes under
the papal regime, would render such
a prohibition in their cases superfluous.
Again, those who are for continuing
the celibacy system urge that
a fellowship is intended only as a
stepping-stone to a permanent provision
in the view of the world, and
that to allow the marriage of Fellows
would render the succession so slow
as to destroy the practical value of
the foundations. To this is opposed
the statement that in fact men are
well content to settle down on a fellowship,
which is indeed a premium
on indolence, and that they acquire,
even if industrious, habits of expense,
which make them loth to part with
a large proportion of their incomes
without grave cause, so that in fact
many men do continue Fellows until
late in life, when they care naturally
less about marriage; and moreover,
that the slowness of succession might
equally be urged in the case of livings
which only become vacant by death,
and that for the same reason it would
be equally reasonable to enforce the
celibacy of bishops were they not
expressly commanded to be husbands,
as some interpret Scripture;
yet more, the fellowship might be
made tenable for a certain number of
years only, and superannuation might
not entail, as it does now, the loss
of the chance of college patronage
to livings. Some satirical writers
have drawn a humorous picture
of the condition of colleges with
sets of rooms inhabited by family
Fellows, the quadrangles turned into
play-grounds, and the sacred grass-plots
invaded by nursemaids with
their charges, still further presuming
to imagine intestine feuds between
jealous <em>fellowinnen</em> (as you
Germans would call them), which
they think would be incompatible
with the feeling of collegiate brotherhood
or sisterhood. To this it may
be answered, that, as it is, the majority
of Fellows reside in the country,
and are otherwise occupied than
with collegiate duties, and there
would be less inducement than formerly
for the plural Fellow to content
himself with the limited accommodation
of a college; and it would
be easy to make a rule that a certain
number of the Fellows,—that is to
say, of the younger, should reside
to undertake the offices; and even
if they were married, those offices
should only continue so long as to
incur no danger of their inundating
the quadrangles with urchins. The
worst of it is, that the Oxford education
has a peculiar tendency to develop
the poetical and artistic temperament;
and to men of this
temperament, who are, in all countries,
in a much larger proportion to
others than is generally thought, the
long vista of celibacy is little else
than a long perspective of purgatory.
To all who love the beautiful, whether
saints or sinners, there is one
central point round which all their
thoughts revolve—one standard by
which all their comparisons are
made,—and that is none other than
woman. The musical mind is drawn
to her through the symphonies of
Mozart or Handel—through the
complicated opera strain, and the
simple national air—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The soul of love and bravery;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>for even the hero-songs of war, by
arousing the manliness of man, suggest
the loveliness of woman. The
artistic mind is drawn to her through
all the schools of painting—through
even the sumptuous Madonnas which
the sacred painters have imagined,
as through the sun-warm but less
heavenly creations of Titian or Correggio.
It is impossible for the
artistic eye to look at the symmetry
of a tree or the graceful lines of a
mountain, or even the crystal curves
in a fountain, without dwelling on that
form which, of all created, is undeniably
the most beautiful without
any of its associations, and dwelling
on it, too, with somewhat other feelings
than those expressed by the
Italian priest when he remarked, in
a tone of reproof, to a friend who
wished to call his attention to a fair
lady at an assembly—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="it">Una bella creatura di Dio!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus I do think that if this celibacy
is to be continued, it would be a
great improvement to enjoin the
study of pure mathematics on college
Fellows, with examinations at intervals
to prove that their time is only
taken up in contemplating the affinities
of triangles, and the love of the
angles (not of the angels). The
whole series of classical literature
ought to be forbidden them for
the time; ditto all galleries, pictures,
and statues, all music and poetry;
and they ought, as a final measure,
to be relegated to that monastery
mentioned by Mr Curzon, somewhere
in the Acroceraunian mountains,
where there were some Greek monks
who had never seen a female face,
and had even forgotten their mothers.
One of them asked him whether
women were like the Madonna.
The poor fellow had better not have
seen that Madonna. Even now,
some men in their undergraduate
life grow tired of the exclusively
masculine aspect of the University,
and some very good lines on that
subject, of which I only recollect the
end, were written by a now eminent
poet, when he was an undergraduate—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“As I am one who feels the full divinity</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a fair face in woman, I protest</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m sick of this unvaried regularity</div>
      <div class='line'>Of whiskered cheeks and chins of black barbarity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And one painful consequence of the
present system is, the violation of
the good old adage, “Happy’s the
wooing that’s not long a-doing:” the
notorious evil of long engagements
becomes, in this case, exaggerated to
a painful degree. There being no
absolute, but only a conditional prohibition,
and the prospect of a living,
certain though distant, appearing to
justify the formation of such ties,
engagements are formed in early
life, the ratification of which seems
ever near, but never actually comes,
till both parties have passed their
meridian, and the fulfilment takes
place, if it is thought worth while
that it should take place at all, rather
as a matter of course, than because
the parties really now desire
it. The hope deferred which “maketh
the heart sick,” embitters the masculine
temper, and withers the feminine
frame, even before their natural
bloom would have disappeared. The
courage which, in earlier life, would
have taken a bold step, and dared
the world to do its worst, becomes
irresolution and timidity; and as it
often happens that those who have
been kept without food too long, only
know the sensation of hunger through
a general faintness of the system, so
the vacuum of the affections too long
kept up by circumstances, becomes
at last a chronic disease, which, to
the end of life, remains irremediable.
At the same time, the life of the
common-room, and the extreme ease
with which material wants are
provided for, acts on the mind as
opium acts on the system, till at
last it ceases to care for anything but
the drug which has become a habit.
It may be with some of those who
have felt the enduring influence of
this soporific regime, as with the
lotos-eaters of Tennyson; they even
come to dread a change, and cling to
the indolence from which at first
they would have fled:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“Our island home</div>
      <div class='line'>Is far beyond the sea, we will no longer roam.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But, on the other hand, it may be
urged that the immediate happiness
of those concerned is not so much
contemplated in the foundations as
their usefulness, and that they must
be content to cull the flowers which
grow beside the path of duty. This
may be answered by urging that, in
certain cases, a man’s usefulness is
diminished instead of being increased
by his being denied certain sources
of happiness. The best workman is
ever the man who is best fed and
clothed, and made most generally
comfortable; even so in the great
work of human life is that individual
most efficient whose legitimate wants,
both of body and soul, are satisfied.
The motives which actuated the
founders of the Roman Catholic colleges
were no doubt, as most human
motives are, of a mixed nature. On
the one hand, they wished their
money to fructify and do as much
good as possible; on the other hand,
they wished it to fructify in such a
way as to redeem their own souls
from purgatory, by providing a succession
of those who should sing
masses for them for all time; at the
same time, it was the prevailing notion
in these times, and is now, among
Romanists, that celibacy, if not the
happiest, is the holiest state of man.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
If there be any truth in this, even to
the most limited extent, there is
something to be said for the system;
but if the poor founders have been
cheated out of their masses, and may
remain, for all the present generation
care, boiling and broiling in purgatory
to the end of time, it seems
purely hypocritical to lean on a notion
which has no better foundation
than the ruling opinions of founders.
All the great and imposing faith is gone
which would support a heavy burden
with the supernatural sinews of
religion, and the burden remains still
to be borne as it best may by human
muscle alone. But it may be also
said, the fellowships of colleges are
in themselves eleemosynary institutions,
and poverty was in most cases
made a condition of the enjoyment
of them; and just as, under the new
poor-law system, we imagine that a
man, though he has a right to existence,
has no right to encumbrances
which others must support, so some
would argue that the charity of the
founders ought to be thankfully accepted
under all its conditions. But
in the first place, the question may
be asked, whether apparent necessity,
rather than humanity, did not
suggest the new poor-law system?
In the next place, whether that
can strictly be called eleemosynary
of which merit is made a condition?
We give to a beggar sometimes, although
we know him to be utterly
worthless, merely because he is destitute;
and even the utterly worthless
have a certain claim, in right of their
Maker’s image; but we give to a good
man as a tribute to his virtue, and
the application of these foundations
to proficiency in knowledge is to
those who accept them usually accounted
peculiarly honourable, just
as a national pension is to the wounded
soldier. Besides, it might be said
that all bequests are in a manner
eleemosynary, because the legacy is
not a payment for labour in most
cases, but a free gift from the testator
to the legatee; nor is its character
materially altered by the fact of
its having been given under conditions.
It appears to some that the
college property is as much real property
to those who have the use of
it, as any property bequeathed subject
to conditions; such as, for instance,
the law of entail in England.
Indeed, a case has been mentioned,
in which, for some peculiar reason,
a very rich man inherited his estates
subject to this very condition of celibacy.
And eleemosynary institutions,
strictly so called, are commonly administered
by trustees, not by those
who reap the benefits of them, as is
the case with college fellowships. I
think I have now, as well as I can,
stated the arguments, both <em>pro</em> and
<em>con</em>, though perhaps it is easy for you
to see to which side I lean. I confess
that I should regard the repeal of
celibacy as a conservative change,
because it would give individuals a
more enduring interest in their
University. I dread innovation, and
especially from profane hands; at
the same time, I feel the necessity
of such wholesome repairs in the
constitution of Alma Mater as
shall secure for her, as far as possible,
a perpetuity of youth, or at
least a green old age. How other
changes, such as the admission of
Dissenters, can be brought about
without ignoring the entire history,
associations, and character of the
University, I do not well see. If
Dissenters are admitted at all, Roman
Catholics must be admitted with the
rest; and they may perhaps lay claim
to a participation in the good things
of the University, seeing that the ancient
foundations were undoubtedly
made in their favour; and if this
participation be allowed, the rights
of the foundation will be again disturbed;
and they may push their
claim to the entire exclusion of
all other communities, for, unless
there be a reason for disfranchising
them, they will ask why others
should share advantages originally
intended for them alone. They are
not like the Jews, a sect who keep
to themselves, and seek not to domineer
over others; but universal
dominion is as much the policy of
pontifical as of imperial Rome. Thus
they will be sure to take every
advantage. Thus there is a <i><span lang="la">primâ
facie</span></i> danger in mooting any integral
question concerning the constitution
of the University, lest an opening
should be unwarily made which would
destroy everything on which its existence
depends; and this is, in my opinion,
the most plausible argument in
favour of continuing the celibacy of
Fellows. But averse as all well-wishers
to Oxford would be to any
change in the way of subtraction or
diminution of her privileges, no such
one could look with coldness on any
proposed additions to her area of
efficiency, and especially on extensions
which seem suggested by her
natural aptitudes. As Cambridge
seems to possess the soil in which
everything connected, however remotely,
with science, is destined especially
to thrive, such as natural history
in its various branches, so does
Oxford appear to be that University
which should assume a prominently
artistic character. The foundations of
a new museum have been laid, which
is to be built on a grand and imposing
scale. Is its chief attraction,
when completed, to consist in a collection
of dried beetles and stuffed
humming-birds, or even a complete
skeleton of the megatherium, if such
a thing is to be had; or is an attempt
to be made to bring together, by
every possible means, a collection of
works of art which would really do
credit to the University? It must be
remembered that we have in England
no national gallery worthy of the
name; not that the pictures composing
the collection in Trafalgar
Square are to be despised—far
from it; but the building which contains
them shows them to so little advantage,
and is altogether so inadequate,
that it presents few temptations
to large additions, either by
purchase, gift, or bequest. The very
atmosphere of London is an argument
against building a new national
gallery in the neighbourhood of any
of the centres of metropolitan life.
Trees may be blackened, but flourish
under the soot; but the purity of the
marble, and the freshness of the canvass,
are liable to be permanently discoloured
by the constant action of an
air impregnated with smoke, in a manner
far other than that in which they
receive the mere mellowness of age.
This would be conclusive against a
central situation, and if such a building
is to be placed in the suburb, to
arrive at it would cost a sacrifice
of time and effort little short of that
necessary to arrive at a site at a
moderate railroad distance from the
metropolis. As it is, Oxford is a great
point of attraction to all strangers,
and no Englishman who had not seen
it, could pretend to an average knowledge
of his own country. It is even
placed within reach of the working-classes
of London by excursion-trains,
who are thus led in the pursuit of
pure air to a place full of associations,
which are in every way likely to do
them good. It seems to me that it
is worth considering whether the
national gallery of England might not
with advantage be placed at Oxford,
and combined in some way with the
scheme of the new museum. A
school of art would probably spring
up around it, to which the University
would naturally present many advantages,
and to which it might well
extend peculiar privileges. The present
is not the worst time to consider
this matter, when the existence of a
great war postpones the execution of
all plans of subordinate importance.
It is quite certain that everything
cannot be concentrated in London;
and this being the case, it is well to
consider what other places are calculated,
in their own way, to become
capital cities. Oxford has already
received some of the Muses as its inmates,
and it is abundantly spacious
to receive them all. With respect to
the natural scenery of its environs,
very much might be said in favour
of its being suited as a residence for
an artist. The banks of its rivers are
especially fertile in subjects for the
brush, and though its upland scenery
is generally stamped with that mediocrity
which seems peculiar to the
central counties of England, there are
spots here and there which, from
their wildness or woodiness, are well
adapted for the sketcher. I am
sorry to see many of the wild places
round Oxford either already enclosed,
or in course of enclosure; but what I
saw with most regret was, that
Bagley Wood had been surrounded
with a fence, and placed under a
most rigorous <em>taboo</em> to the public in
general. Now, there is some excuse
for bringing land into cultivation
which may be made available for the
wants of the community, and can
only become so if enclosed; but when
the better preservation of game is the
only object, to exclude the public
from a place where they have been
accustomed for years to expatiate
and “recreate themselves,” and an
intelligent public, such as that of the
University;—to exclude them from one
of the spots which Arnold mentioned
as giving him especial delight on his
return to Oxford, and as being one of
its chief glories,—this, though perfectly
justifiable according to law, is
scarcely consistent with that Aristotelian
equity which ought to be above
law, especially in the neighbourhood
of those brought up in his precepts,
and whose philanthropy might naturally
be expected to be more expansive
than that of other men. It appears,
however, that this mischief has
been done for some time; and the
only compensation the public gain is
that a fine wide road has been made,
which certainly makes the walk round
the wood complete—a poor consolation,
indeed, to those who, like myself,
look upon walking along a road
as one of the dreariest duties imaginable,
and have an irreclaimable vein
of the savage in their composition.
Why, to me the sight of the stiff
hedges and mathematical drains of
Bagley Wood would spoil half the
pleasure of shooting there; but, of
course, those who have that privilege
may say that the grapes are sour. I
may mention that on the walk which
crosses the railway, and cuts across
into the Abingdon road, which leads
through Bagley Wood, a large reservoir
has lately been made, which
in one place is crossed by a bridge,
that seems as if it had been put
there on purpose to give the best near
view of the city. The best distant
views I consider to be those about the
Hinksey fields, near the spot where
Turner, with singular ignorance of
the customs of the University, painted
gownsmen in their academicals
among the haycocks; and at a place
near Elstree, called Stow Wood, well
known as a fox-cover. But perhaps
the most characteristic view of all is
that of the towers of Oxford, seen reflected
in the flooded surface of Christchurch
meadow under a red sky.
This view is suggestive of Venice,
especially if the boats are magnified
by a slight effort of the imagination
into sea-going ships, or softened into
gondolas. I have mentioned the advantages
which an artist might derive
from residence in Oxford, alike
from the models that might be placed
there, the architectural beauties of
the place, and the natural scenery.
To the second of these advantages
would belong the excellent studies of
interiors that some of the rooms present.
The rooms of one of my friends,
which were those at first intended for
the Head of the College, are quite a
gem in the profuseness of decoration,
especially as applied to the ceiling.
The halls of many of the colleges are
also remarkably fine, as presenting
studies of interiors of peculiar magnificence.
Occasionally the internal
decoration of the rooms themselves,
in which individual taste has perhaps
taken a wider range than in any other
place I know, would assist a painter
in his composition. Pictures and
engravings, profuse in quantity, if not
always good in quality, decorate the
rooms of most of the junior members,
and a marked improvement has of
late years taken place in this matter,
engravings from good masters, and
really good original pictures by modern
artists, having taken the place of
trumpery hunting-prints and portraits
of the nymphs of the ballet. Other
rooms are hung round “with pikes,
and guns, and bows,” now obsolete,
and seemingly made, at the time of
their construction, for this ulterior
object of ornamenting a room, which
they fulfil so much better than any
modern invention. But perhaps the
most extraordinary rooms of all are
those of a friend of mine, in one of
the most picturesque colleges. The
whole centre of his room is taken up
by a kind of immense Christmas tree,
formed by his own labour and ingenuity,
on which is hung every imaginable
article that would be chosen in
an old curiosity-shop from mere oddness
in form or nature. It is a rare
collection of what the French call
specimens of “bêtises,” ironically, as
I suppose, considering the extreme
cleverness which imagined them all.
There are, if I rightly remember,
gods from the Sandwich Islands and
fetishes from Africa, clubs from New
Zealand and bows from Tartary,
stuffed birds, pipes of all kinds and
sizes, skins of snakes and crocodiles,
skulls of men and animals, and everything,
in fact, that ever entered into a
skull to devise. The walls are papered
with engravings, and engravings are
hung from the ceiling because there is
no room for them on the walls. There
is a collection of divers plants, native
or exotic, flourishing in stands or
trailing over the windows, in each of
which is a kind of caravanserai for
wild birds (not aviary), for the amiable
proprietor does not detain them there
longer than they wish to stay, but invites
them in by abundant proffers of
their peculiar kinds of food; and as he
sits or reclines by his fire (for he has
abundant facilities for assuming either
position) by the motionless silence
which he purposely observes—has
constant opportunities of watching
their flittings and hearing their twitterings,
and studying their little
habits with the gusto of a naturalist.
That such an inventory, which entirely
passes my memory to describe,
should have been amassed in a single
room by any amount of time and
trouble, is a marvel to me, only to be
explained by the perfect and lotos-eating
repose of a college life. Long may
our friend enjoy his quaint and instructive
rooms! Travellers see
strange things, but few can say that
they have seen stranger than those
that are enshrined in the colleges of
Oxford.</p>

<p class='c009'>You see that I have carefully abstained
in what I have said from
making invidious comparisons between
Oxford and the sister university;
nor have I spoken of the universities
of the north, with which I
am but little acquainted, but which
I should imagine to hold an intermediate
place between the English and
the German system. On the whole,
it appears to me that the function of
education, comprising theology, philosophy,
science, and belles lettres, is
to impress upon the mind images of
Beauty and Truth, and to enable the
mind which has received these impressions
to act in like manner
through life. If education cannot
make a man’s actions truthful and
beautiful, he remains to the end a
savage, or rather, I should say, the
scion of a vulgar civilisation, even if
he knows all the poets by heart, or
can discourse with the acumen of an
Erasmus or a Crichton. That Beauty
and Truth are one and the same in
that perfect sunlight which our eyes
cannot see, and from which all lesser
lights proceed, few will deny. But
here on earth they may be considered
as in a measure apart, and as exciting,
each for good in its way, separate
influences on the moral life of man.
Men incline to one or the other light
according to their natural bent or the
bias of their education. It seems to
me that if a distinction is to be made
between our universities, the tendency
of Oxford studies is to look at
Truth through Beauty, while that of
Cambridge studies is to look at Beauty
through Truth. It is therefore that
I have laid so much stress on the
capabilities of Oxford as a school of
Art. I confess that I am anxious to
gain a closer insight into the nature
and life of your German universities.
Probably they are with us but imperfectly
and unfairly understood. If
it be true that the Bursch preserves,
under his outwardly rough exterior,
any remains of that antique chivalry
of thought which is so fast dying out
in this country, he preserves a treasure
which is of inestimable value, and
which ought to be secured to him at
any price. At the same time, I think
you will allow that our system has
certain superiorities of its own, which
deserve at least careful study, if not
active imitation. We, at least, are
successful in affixing an ineffaceable
stamp to the character of the great
majority, while you seem only to succeed
in permanently impressing the
nature of a few, and impressing only
a limited part of that nature. May
you live and lecture many years, Herr
Professor; and may your brimming
Rhine flow on for ever, free and German
as of yore; and may the vine-blight
spare the clusters that yield
that molten gold which, unlike the
morbid production of Australia and
California, brings nothing but innocent
joy to the soul of your Fatherland.
<em>Vale!</em> and believe me,</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE ANCIENT COINS OF GREECE.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Father Hardouin, a learned
French Jesuit of the seventeenth century,
lived to the venerable age of
eighty-three years, and died, as he had
lived, in the full persuasion that the
only authentic monuments which we
possess of classical antiquity are comprised
in coins, a few Greek and
Latin inscriptions, with the Georgics
of Virgil, the Satires and Epistles of
Horace, and the writings of Pliny
and Cicero. Out of these materials
he held that certain ingenious “falsarii,”
in the thirteenth century, whom
he styles the “architects of annals,”
compiled those multifarious productions
of poetry and prose which we
have been accustomed to regard as
a most precious legacy bequeathed
to us by ancient Greece and Rome.
This fact we mention to our readers,
not with any view to shake them in
their old and orthodox convictions
upon the subject, but simply to show
them what a vast amount of <em>matériel</em>
this learned Father had discovered
in the study of ancient numismatics.
A coin indubitably presents, within
the smallest compass, the fullest view
of ancient times that we possess.
Though silent, it is always waiting
to communicate knowledge; though
small, it is always ready to teach
great things. “Inest sua gratia
parvis,” is the motto of the Cabinet.
It would be difficult, indeed, to say
what department of ancient lore—whether
in mythology, or economics,
or politics, or chronology, or
geography—may not be elucidated
and explained by the study of coins.
A series of coins are, in fact, a
series of illustrative engravings, of
contemporaneous date with the literary
works of Greece and Rome,
and of the noblest school of art.
We may realise much of what we
read by turning to designs executed
by artists who lived in those very
countries, and at that very period.
The lordly oak is uprooted by the
tempest, the lowly willow is spared.
While the temples of the gods and
their concomitant myriads of statues
have been reduced to unintelligible
fragments, those coins which
formed the medium of ordinary traffic—the
tetrobolus, the soldier’s daily
pay—the drachma, that of the mariner—and
the tetradrachmon, which,
by virtue of the archaic visage of
Pallas, with her rigid smile, passed
current among merchants of every
state and province,—these have remained
safe in their hiding-places
under the soil, and may be found in
nearly the same condition in which
the Greeks handled them more than
two thousand years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cities have been built with the
express intent of perpetuating the
glory of a founder, and after all
the founder’s intent is achieved,
not by the enduring testimony of
edifices and streets of marble, but
by that of its coins. Thus the
Emperor Augustus thought to immortalise
the fame of his victory over
Antony and Cleopatra at Actium,
by erecting a city on the shores of
the Ambracian Gulf, which city he
called by the appropriate name of
Nicopolis. It was supplied with the
usual complement of public edifices;
a gymnasium and a stadium were
built in a sacred grove in the suburb;
another sanctuary stood on the
sacred hill of Apollo, which surmounted
the city. It was admitted
by the Emperor’s desire into the
Amphictyonic council, and was made
a Roman colony. Sacred games
were instituted, accompanied by a
sacrifice and a festival, equal in dignity
to the four great games of
Greece. Coins of the city were
struck: and in commemoration of a
favourable omen which had presented
itself on the morning of the
day of battle, a group of bronze
statues, representing an ass and his
driver,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> were placed, among other
dedications, in the temple of Apollo
Actius.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such were the forward-looking expedients
of the conqueror to perpetuate
his fame;—and what has
been the result?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Look, where the second Cæsar’s trophies rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now,—like the hands that made them, withering.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A long succession of ruined edifices,
in one part converted into a sheep-pen.
In fact, before four centuries
had elapsed, a contemporaneous author
tells us that the town of Nicopolis
had fallen into lamentable decay.
The palaces of the nobles were rent;
the aqueducts crushed; everything
was smothered with dust and rubbish.—The
bronze statues of Eutyches and
Nicon, after being removed first to
Rome, and then to adorn the Hippodrome
at Constantinople, were at last
melted down by the barbarous Latins
on their capture of the city in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1204. All is gone of Nicopolis except
the coins. The coins may be
seen in the cabinet of the numismatist,
by time as yet uninjured;
and we find upon one of them the
head of Augustus himself with the
description of Κτίστης or founder, and
the appropriate figure of Victory holding
a garland in her extended right
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>In connection with this city of Nicopolis,
we may mention the fact that
one of the most important transactions
in Colonel Leake s diplomatic career—namely,
a conference with the celebrated
Albanian Vezír, Ali Pasha,
which led to the ratification of a
peace with the Porte in 1808—took
place on the sea-beach, near the ruins
of the ancient aqueduct of the city,
on a stormy night in the winter of
1807. The crafty Vezír, in order
to throw dust into the eyes of the
French consul, who was watching
the proceedings with much jealousy,
had previously got up a sort of scene
in his presence,—receiving an English
messenger, whom he had himself instructed
to ask for permission to purchase
provisions, with affected sternness,—haughtily
refusing to grant his
request,—and declaring that the two
nations were still at war;—although
he had already made with Colonel
Leake a private arrangement to give
him the meeting that same evening
on the beach. As the day declined,
the weather became so threatening
that the captain of Colonel Leake’s
ship was afraid to anchor off the
coast; and so dark was the night,
that had not Ali himself caused muskets
to be discharged, the appointed
place of rendezvous on the beach
could not have been discovered. At
length the boat neared the land, and
the Vezír was found seated under a
little cliff attended by one or two
of his suite, and a few guards. Dr
Johnson might seem to have anticipated
this scene, in his tragedy of
<cite>Irene</cite>, where he describes an interview
between the Greek Demetrius and the
Vezír Cali in these words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He led me to the shore where Cali sate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pensive, and listening to the beating surge.</div>
      <div class='line'>There, in soft hints and in ambiguous phrase,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all the diffidence of long experience,</div>
      <div class='line'>That oft had practised fraud, and oft detected,</div>
      <div class='line'>The veteran courtier half revealed his project.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During the two hours the conference
between Colonel Leake and
the Vezír lasted, the surf rose considerably;
and it was not without a
good drenching from the rain and the
sea, and some difficulty also in finding
the ship, which they could hardly
have done without the aid of the
lightning, that the boat returned on
board. The ship then stood away
from the coast.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But to return to our subject.
Every one who feels a thirst for
knowledge, must value coins as the
medium of acquiring knowledge:
every one who has an eye for grace
and beauty, must value them as presenting
unrivalled specimens of grace
and beauty: every one who is susceptible
of the charms of fancy, must
love to study the hidden meaning of
those imaginative devices, which
sometimes, as Addison says, contain
as much poetry as a canto of Spenser.
Let not the study be condemned as
dry and crabbed, for Petrarch was a
numismatist. Let it not be condemned
as connected with only a bygone
and obsolete school of art, for
Raffaelle and Rubens, Canova, Flaxman,
Thorwaldsen, and Chantrey, delighted
to refresh their powers by it.
Condemn it not as beneath the notice
of the philosopher, for Newton and
Clarendon were among its votaries.
Say not that men of active pursuits
can find no time for it, when you
hear of the collections of Wren,
Mead, and Hunter.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were numismatists among
the ancient Romans. Admirers and
collectors, as they were, of the other
productions of Greek art, we should
conclude that they were admirers and
collectors of Greek coins also, even if
we had no direct evidence upon the
subject. Suetonius, however, expressly
informs us that the Emperor
Augustus was accustomed—probably
at the Saturnalia—to distribute among
his guests a variety of valuable and
interesting gifts, and, among the
rest, pieces of money—not modern
money, but of ancient date—not
Roman, but foreign; and some of it
the coin of ancient kings. May we
not recognise in this description the
beautiful coins of Greece and her
colonies—the coins of Syracuse and
of Tarentum—of the Seleucidæ and
other Asiatic kings—of the kings of
Macedonia, Epirus, and Thrace? A
facetious friend of ours professes to
enrol Horace also in the list of numismatists;
and we have often smiled
at the mock solemnity with which
he argues his point. He holds, for
instance, that the passage,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Nullus argento color est avaris</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Abdito terris</span>”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>refers, not as we have been taught to
interpret it, to the unwrought silver
lying hidden as yet in the mine,
but to those choice productions of
ancient art—Syracusan medallions,
for instance, or the rarer tetradrachms
of the Seleucidæ—which blush unseen
in their subterranean lurking-places,
and are kept out of our cabinets by
that churlish miser the earth. And
he holds that the poet very consistently,
in the same ode, assigns the
regal diadem, and the laurel crown
of virtue, not to the man who is
simply master enough of himself not
to covet his neighbour’s money-bags,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Quisquis ingentes oculo irretorto</span></div>
      <div class='line in2'><span lang="la">Spectat acervos</span>,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>but rather to the noble self-denial of
that numismatist, who can pass from
the contemplation of the well-stored
cabinet of his rival without one sidelong
glance of envy.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in that well-known passage
where Horace says, in a rather boastful
strain, that the fame of his lyric
poetry will be more durable than
bronze, our friend observes that if
the poet alluded to the statues of
bronze which met his eye at every
turn in the city of Rome, it did not
follow that his lyric fame would be
of any long duration; for of all articles
of bronze the statue was doomed
to the earliest destruction, and but
few, in comparison with the number
of marble statues, have come down
to our time. Many a graceful figure
which Horace had seen and admired
in the palace of Mecænas, for instance,
ere many centuries had
elapsed was melted down by greedy
plunderers, and played its part a second
time in the brazen caldron of
the housewife. But the medal of
bronze survives the wear and tear
of centuries full a score. The medal
it is,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Possit diruere, aut innumerabilis</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Annorum series, et fuga temporum.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Our observation has been drawn
by some modern writers to the supposed
existence of a sacred character
or quality in the coin of the ancients.
It is the opinion of the most experienced
numismatists that the Greek
coin was invested with a character
of sanctity, arising from the head, or
figure, or symbol of some deity which
it usually bore; that the ἐικών or
image upon it was really and truly
an idol. We believe that such a notion
prevailed, to a certain extent,
both among the Greeks and the Romans.
Not that we regard the worship
of Juno Moneta as a case in
point. We think that the worship of
Juno Moneta was the worship of a
deity who was supposed to have admonished
the Romans that there are
other things in the world much better
worth attending to than money,
and that money would not be wanting
to them, so long as the weapons
they fought with were the arms of
justice. At the same time, there
was indubitably a reverence paid
to the coin, even down to the
Roman times, for the sake of its
religious symbol or device. The
people of Aspendus, in Pamphylia,
professed to hold in such reverence
the effigy of the Emperor Tiberius
upon his coin, that they found a
certain fellow-citizen guilty of impiety,
simply on the ground of his
having administered a little wholesome
chastisement to a refractory
slave who happened to have at the
time one such coin in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been thought that the practice
which prevailed among the Greeks,
of placing a piece of coin in the mouth
of the corpse, originated in this notion
of its sanctity, inasmuch as it was
supposed to insure the protection of
the deity, whoever it might be, to
whom the coin was attached by the
symbol it bore. But we must confess
that, for our own part, we still
cling to the old story of the fee required
by the Stygian ferryman.
Hercules informs Bacchus, in the
<cite>Ranæ</cite> of Aristophanes, when he is
meditating a visit to the shades below,
that he will arrive at a wide
unfathomable lake, and that an old
man who attends for the purpose
will ferry him and his companion
across it, on receiving the fee of two
oboli. Lucian, too, has a joke about
Charon’s complaining that, in consequence
of the slackness of his trade,
he cannot raise money enough to supply
the necessary repairs for his boat.
The <em>mouth</em> was so commonly used as
a purse by the Greek in his lifetime,
that we can scarcely wonder at this
method being adopted for his carrying
money into the other world with
him when dead. Colonel Leake mentions
the discovery of a coin of
Motya in the mouth of a skeleton
in the island of Ithaca, in a tomb of
the first century before Christ.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time, although we believe
that the myth of Charon was
more closely connected with this
practice in the minds of the common
people than any other consideration,
we doubt not that the sanctity
of the coin was also taken into account.
We find that notion of sanctity
prevailing, not only among the
Greeks and Romans, but among
other nations, to a considerable extent.
The Mohammedan coin bears
invariably a passage from the Koran,
or some other religious text, quite
sufficient to insure its reverential
treatment by the faithful Mussulman;
and we read in Marsden’s <cite><span lang="fr">Numismata
Orientalia</span></cite> of a certain class of very
rare gold coins of ancient date, to
which the Hindoos avowedly paid
religious worship. Of this coin the
Rajah of Tanjore was so fortunate as
to possess two specimens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether the sect of gold-worshippers
is yet extinct is a question which
we must leave moralists to settle
among themselves. It has been remarked
by an accomplished scholar
and excellent numismatist,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> that
“gold has been worshipped in all
ages without hypocrisy.” That there
were many in ancient times who
held the coin in reverence for the
sake of an indwelling sanctity connected
with the symbolic representations
which it bore, we fully believe;
and that there may be some in modern
times who hold it in reverence,—ἀισχρου
κέρδους χάριν,—we are by
no means disposed to deny.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no doubt that pieces of
antique coin have been frequently
carried in the purse or in the pocket
as a sort of charm or amulet; but we
question whether this notion of their
supernatural power has any connection
with the supposed sanctity of
the legends or symbols with which
they are impressed. We should ascribe
it rather to the same feeling
which induces some old women, and
young ones too, to carry a crooked
sixpence in their purse—the charm
being supposed to reside, not in any
device or legend of the coin, but
simply in its curvilinear shape. So
in the cases we have just alluded to,
the charm lies in the mystery of the
coin’s unknown and ancient origin—“omne
ignotum pro magnifico est.”
Stukeley tells us that, in the neighbourhood
of one of the ancient Roman
sites which he visited in his
“<cite><span lang="la">Iter Curiosum</span></cite>,” Roman coins were
known among the peasantry by the
appellation of “swine pennies,” from
the fact of their being often turned
up by that indefatigable excavator
in his search after something more
succulent. To the mighty Cæsars
this was truly a degradation. But
at Dorchester he found the same
coins known by the name, assigned
with more semblance of respect, of
“Dorn pennies,” after some mythical
king Dor, whom tradition states to
have once resided there. The rustic
antiquary is wont to labour under a
sad confusion of ideas. The Roman
he confounds perpetually with the Roman
Catholic. We remember ourselves—after
visiting a sort of bi-linguar
monument near Hadleigh in Suffolk,
which marks the spot of the martyrdom
of Dr Rowland Taylor, under Queen
Mary—to have asked a passer-by
whether a certain antiquated mansion
by the road-side had ever been inhabited
within his recollection; to
which we received the oracular reply
that, to the best of our rustic
friend’s belief, it had never been inhabited
since the Romans occupied
it, in the days of Dr Taylor!</p>

<p class='c009'>This, however, is rather a digression.
We learn from Trebellius
Pollio that, in the fourth century, the
coins of Alexander the Great were
supposed to insure prosperity to any
person who was prudent enough to
carry one of them constantly about
his person; and we find this, and all
other such notions, strongly condemned
by Chrysostom. An Italian
traveller tells us that, in 1599, the
silver coins found in the fields in a
certain district in the island of Crete
were called by the people after the
name of St Helen; and that the story
went that this saint, being in want of
money, had made a number of coins
of brass, endowing them, at the same
time, with such miraculous properties,
that the brass, in passing into
the hands of another person, was at
once changed into silver; and, moreover,
that any such silver coin being
held fast in the hand, will cure the
falling-sickness. Mr Pashley, who
visited Crete in 1830, found that the
possession of an ancient coin is looked
upon as a sovereign charm against
maladies of the eyes. In the year
1366, the discovery made by some
children at play of a number of ancient
coins, at Tourves, near Marseilles,
threw the whole community
of the district into a state of alarm
and consternation. The coins were
some that had been struck at Marseilles
at that early period when,
under the name of Massalia, it ranked
among the most thriving colonies of
ancient Greece. They bore on the
one side a head of Apollo, and on the
other a circle divided into quadrants.
In the chronicles of Provence, where
this discovery is recorded, they are
described as bearing on the one side
a <em>Saracen’s head</em>, and on the other
side a <em>cross</em>. This was interpreted as
bearing some portentous allusion to
the Crusades. And the devout writer
intimates that, while one part of the
community look upon it as an omen
of good, and the other part as an
omen of evil, Heaven only knows
how it will turn out.</p>

<p class='c009'>We believe that some persons,
sedulously devoted to other branches
of the study of classical antiquity, are
deterred from availing themselves of
the aid of coins, by a fear of being
imposed upon by forgeries. This is
an easy, but an idle mode of putting
aside that which we have not courage
to investigate. We shall add a few
remarks upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place, we shall venture
to ask these anti-numismatic sceptics,
whether they think we ought to cease
to read and to admire the dramas of
Shakespeare, because it is questionable
whether one or two of those which
pass under his name were really of
his composition?—or, whether we
shall shut our eyes before all pictures
which pass under the names of
the Old Masters, because spurious ones
have been palmed off upon the self-dubbed
connoisseur?—or whether all
autographs of illustrious men are to be
condemned as trash, because Ireland
attempted to impose upon the public
with some that were not genuine?—or
whether all currency is to come
to an end, because clever knaves have
succeeded in counterfeiting it? Everything,
in short, which is valuable,
offers, in proportion to its value, a
temptation to ingenious and unscrupulous
men to show their cleverness
by imposing upon the world with an
imitation of it. The Holy Scripture
itself has not escaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>And after all, in regard to coins as
well as in regard to the other subjects
which we have mentioned, although
forgers may be clever, detectors are
clever also. The numismatic phalanx
of investigators are more than a
match for the “falsarii.” The skill
of Cavino, Gambello, and Cellini, has
been met with equal skill on the part
of the numismatist. The eye that
has been accustomed to wander over
a well-selected cabinet acquires a
power of ready discrimination,—a
power difficult to teach by theory,
but not so difficult to gain by practice.
Solitary instances may occur
of a solitary numismatist fondly persuading
himself that some clever forgery
which he possesses is a genuine
coin, but we would not give much
for his chance of beguiling others into
the same belief. Unwilling he may
be to have the “<i><span lang="la">gratissimus error</span></i>”
extracted from his own mind, but he
never will succeed in engrafting it
upon others. Never does the eye of
man exert so much jealous vigilance
as when it is employed upon the coin
of a rival numismatist claiming to be
genuine upon insufficient grounds,
The House of Lords sitting upon a
claim of some peerage in <em>abeyance</em> is
nothing to it. We apprehend that
scarcely an instance is on record of
a forged coin having enjoyed for any
length of time, unquestioned, the honours
of a genuine one. Nor do we
think that there are many instances
of a forger’s attempting to falsify history.
He generally aims at making
his invention tally with historical fact
as closely as he can. And if his inventive
powers are not at all brought
into exercise, but he simply produces
a coin which is a <em>fac-simile</em> or reproduction
of a genuine one, for purposes
of study that <em>fac-simile</em> will be equally
available with the genuine coin, and
no further harm is done than the abstraction
of a few shillings more than
its value from the pocket of the unwitting
purchaser.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time we would not let
the forger go unpunished. Though
the evil actually done be small, the
intention is bad. We would have
him tried by a jury of numismatists.
Or if the offence should have been
committed in a country where the
power of punishing the offence resides
in one magistrate, we should
say that that one magistrate ought
to be a numismatist. It is said
that a distinguished archæologist
who possessed this power in virtue
of his office as Her Majesty’s
consul at Bagdad, very recently exercised
it by directing that a Jew
“falsarius” should be bastinadoed.
We applaud his Excellency’s most
righteous judgment. The man who
had counterfeited the famous sequins
of Venice, and had aggravated his
crime by doing it badly,—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>is represented by Dante as worthy of
an especial notice among those sinners
against laws divine and moral
with whom he has peopled the shades
of his <cite>Inferno</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seriously, however, we think that
any clever work of art is worthy of
being preserved, and none the less for
its having taken in some who set
themselves up as judges. Even in
Pliny’s time a counterfeit denarius
of superior workmanship was sometimes
thought cheap at the price of
sundry genuine denarii. The tasteful
device of Cellini, or of some cunning
artist of Padua, must not be thrown
to the dogs, merely because it was
produced with the intention of
rivalling the work of ancient artists,
and of testing the acumen of the
cognoscenti. Those figures of Cellini,
for instance, which some one brought
and exhibited to the artist himself as
antiques, and respecting which the
nobleman who was their proprietor
declared, when he saw a smile playing
upon the conscious visage of Cellini,
that there had not lived a man for
these thousand years who could have
wrought such;—would not those
figures have been worth preserving?
And in like manner a coin which, by
the excellence of its workmanship,
has raised a doubt whether it may not
have been really of ancient origin,
ought by no means to be treated with
contempt, even though it proves to
be modern.</p>

<p class='c009'>The learned work of Colonel Leake,
now before us, has supplied a desideratum
in the archæological literature
of our country. It is the first work
of the kind upon Greek coins which
has been published by an Englishman,
and those of our readers who
are acquainted with his character
will agree that no Englishman could
have been found to do it so well as
Colonel Leake. The vast amount of
knowledge which he has been laying
up for more than half a century, in
regard to the literature, the mythology,
the political and social history,
and the geography of ancient Greece,
supplies an infinity of streams which
flow over the pages of his work in the
form of notes. No longer shall we
blush under the well-grounded reproach
that all the standard works
upon Greek coinage are written by
foreigners. Already, indeed, we observe
that Professor L. Müller, in his
<cite><span lang="fr">Numismatique d’Alexandre</span></cite>, just
published at Copenhagen, has made
ample use of Colonel Leake’s volume,
which must necessarily become a
text-book in this branch of Greek
archæology. For the convenience of
those who may consult it, not only is
every ordinary variety of index supplied
to the coins themselves, but we
observe that, in an appendix, an index
is added to the valuable information
contained in the notes. We observe,
also, in the appendix, a very interesting
and learned dissertation upon the
weights of Greek coins, in which
Colonel Leake traces the Attic didrachmon—which
seems to have been
a sort of standard or unit in the
monetary scales of Persia and Lydia,
as well as of the cities and colonies
of Greece—to Phœnicia, and from
Phœnicia to Egypt. It would scarcely
be in accordance with our usual practice
to enter into the more erudite
part of this important subject, and
we shall therefore conclude our remarks
by making one reference to
the work, in order to show how successful
its author has been in availing
himself of the light which a coin may
throw upon the more obscure portions
of ancient geography.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Colonel Leake’s collection there
is a coin, recently brought to light, of
a people called the Orthians, bearing
the Thessalian type of a horse issuing
from a rocky cavern, in allusion to
the story that Neptune produced the
horse originally by a stroke of his trident
upon a Thessalian rock. Now
a city, called “Orthe,” is mentioned
by Homer in the second book of the
Iliad.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> With regard to the site of
this city, there was a difference of
opinion among geographers even in
Strabo’s time; the majority seem to
have identified it with the acropolis
of a more modern city, which at that
time was known by the name of Phalanna.
But inasmuch as there are
coins now extant of Phalanna, and of
a date contemporaneous with that of
Colonel Leake’s coin of Orthe, it is
evident that Phalanna and Orthe were
two separate and distinct places.
The appearance, therefore, of this previously
unknown coin of Orthe corrects
an error which prevailed among
geographers as far back as the time
of Strabo. It shows that Phalanna
and Orthe were not the same place.
Out of the five cities mentioned by
Homer in this passage, Strabo had
well ascertained the position of
three; and Colonel Leake is now
enabled to fix the probable position
of the fourth. In reference to such
facts as this, Colonel Leake observes
in his preface that they have an important
bearing upon the great question
as to the origin of the Homeric
poems.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It seems impossible,” he says, “for
any impartial reader of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, who
is not seeking for arguments in favour of
a preconceived theory; who visits the
scene of the poem; and who, when making
himself acquainted with the <i><span lang="la">Dramatis
Personæ</span></i> in the second book, identifies
the sites of their cities, and thus
finds the accuracy of Homer confirmed
by existing evidence,—to believe that no
such city as Troy ever existed, and that
the Trojan war is a mere poetic invention;
this, too, in defiance of the traditions
of all antiquity, and the belief of
intelligent historians, who lived more
than two thousand years nearer the
event than ourselves. The <cite>Iliad</cite> differs
not from any other poetical history or
historical romance, unless it be in the
great length of time which appears to
have elapsed between the events and the
poem; but which time was employed by
an intelligent people in improving and
perfecting their language and poetry—in
committing, by the latter, past occurrences
to memory; and the principal
subjects of which, therefore, could not
have been any other than religious and
historical.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The study of coins has been very
much facilitated by recent improvements
in the art of electrotype, which
now enables the collector to obtain
perfect copies of the rarer and more
costly specimens, and to render them
as useful to art and literature as the
originals themselves. For purposes
of reference we have a noble collection
in the National Museum, as well
as another which, although of much
more limited extent, is nearer to ourselves,
and therefore more accessible
to students on this side of the
Tweed, at Glasgow. In the concluding
paragraph of his preface, Colonel
Leake mentions these two collections
in connection with each other; and
with that paragraph we shall also
conclude our remarks upon his valuable
work.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Augmented as our National Collection
has been by the bequest of Mr
Payne Knight, by the purchase of the
Bargon Collection, and by similar acquisitions
on the dispersion of the Devonshire,
Thomas, and Pembroke cabinets,
it now rivals most of those on the Continent.
With the addition of the Hunterian
at Glasgow, which the Trustees of
the British Museum have now, at the
end of eighty or ninety years, once more
the opportunity of acquiring, with the
assistance of Government, it would be
the richest in Europe.”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>TICKLER AMONG THE THIEVES!<br> <span class='small'>EXTRACT FROM AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WITH A PREFATORY NOTICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Poor Tickler! The thing happened
in this wise.—But, by the way,
before coming to that, it may not be
amiss to give the reader some idea
who Tickler is:—to wit, a very Skye
of Skyes, with a mouth the roof
whereof is dark as midnight: his
glittering eyes are black as jet; his
ears short, his legs none of the longest,
but his body is: his tail is a
triumph, when fairly spread out;
and as for the strength with which
it is attached to his body, you may
hold him up by the aforesaid tail as
long as you can—with one hand.
Then his hair is pepper-and-salt in
hue, long and curly, and—if I may so
speak (though no one but myself and
the family will know exactly what I
mean by it)—with a kind of silken
wiriness. And as for cleanliness,
why, he is washed thoroughly every
Friday morning, and carefully combed
afterwards; and the recurring day of
that jobation (to use a word of his
own) he is as perfectly acquainted
with as the gentleman who performs
the operation, and has come, in process
of time, even to like the thing:
witness how he jumps into the tub of
warm water of his own accord, alike
in winter and summer, with a kind
of alacrity. He makes no fuss about
it, except that sometimes, when the
soapy water gets into his eyes, they
wink at you in silent suffering, which
he unconsciously aggravates, instead
of alleviating, by putting up his wet
paw to rub them! Through this operation
he has gone for now nearly
twelve years, and a sweeter dog there
is not than Tickler. I may indeed
almost say as much in respect of his
temper, which is excellent whenever
he has everything his own way. I
have reflected a good deal on the
dog’s idiosyncrasy, and think I now
know it well. ’Tis tinctured by a
warm regard for himself, with respect
to the good things of this life;
he says, reasonably enough, that if
there are good things to be had, he
cannot think why he should not try
to get them, and like them, since he
is formed for the purpose, if he can
get them; and as for huge or little
hungry dogs in the street, of the
plebeian order, he does not dislike
to see them enjoying themselves, by
way of giving a zest, as it were, to
starvation,—if he have no fancy himself
for what they have routed out of
the gutter. He says he thinks they
must often be sore driven; for he has
sometimes seen a gaunt dog crunching
a dirty bone till he has actually
almost eaten it! I am sure Tickler
is not without feeling; for one day
he was sitting on a chair, with his
paws resting on the top of it, near
the window, in a warm dining-room,
on a blighting day in February—the
dust-laden wind without seeming
to cut both man and beast to
the very bone: and at the foot of our
steps there had presumed to sit
a dirty half-starved cur, shivering
miserably in every muscle, but uttering
no sound—neither whine nor
bark.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He starved, and made no sign!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Was it necessary for that lout of a
fellow that passed, to kick the unoffending
brute (which did not belong
to him) from our steps, it showing,
however, no resentment, but simply
sitting and shivering a foot or two
farther on? Then Tickler (who is of
patrician descent), whose eyes had
been for some time fixed wistfully
upon his plebeian brother, could hold
his peace no longer, but gave a loud,
fierce, little bark, jumped down from
his chair, and fawned whiningly on
me; and when I took two nice
chicken-bones from his plate under
the sofa, and called the forlorn victim
of man’s chance brutality into the
hall, and gave him the bones, which
he was for a while too cold, and also
timid, to eat for fear of another kick,—Tickler
stood by, not only without
growl or bark, though he knew the
victuals were his, but very complacently
wagging his tail. He had
pity for his poor brother, who seemed
such a wretched little outcast! And
as for the poor voracious creature
before him, crouching guiltily as if he
had done wrong in enjoying himself,
we could hardly find it in our hearts
to put him out again into the street.
If he could have carried away sixpence
to a tripe-shop, he should have
had it to get a complete feast for
once in his life. I think the incident
made a deep impression on
Tickler; for when he returned into
the dining-room, he went again to the
window, and sate for some time
looking through it wistfully, and
whining; and then jumped down,
went under the sofa, and lay there
for upwards of two hours, sighing
several times, and without touching
his victuals.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, on proper occasions, Tickler
could show a proper spirit.
We have a cat; and if there be
any force in the new saying, the
right cat in the right place, Tickler
was the dog to insist on its being
observed; for if ever poor Tom presumed
to steal up-stairs out of the
kitchen (which, it must be owned,
was his proper place), there was
no end of uproar on the part of Tickler;
though Tom would sometimes
turn round, on his way down stairs,
and, curving up his back, and showing
his teeth, glare at his little
tyrant with an expression that was
perfectly fiendish; and tended, moreover,
effectually to keep the right dog
in the right place, viz. the dining-room,
to which he would on these
occasions retreat in good order, perhaps,
not without needless delay.
Thus Tickler had a notion of fitness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was also of a very contemplative
character, shown by his long
sittings on the chair nearest one of
the windows—in fact, always the lefthand
side window. He would sit on
the chair, with his fore-paws resting
on the top of it, and his mouth between
them, calmly surveying so
much of human nature as passed before
our windows. It would have
been strange, indeed, if he could have
lived so long with us,—growing up
with our children, and growing old
alas! with ourselves,—without having
endeared himself to us all in a
hundred different ways, and becoming
thoroughly familiar with our ways
and habits. Can any one persuade
me that the little fellow did not know
6.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> o’clock, at which hour I
pretty regularly returned to dinner,
when he used always to take his seat
on his chair a quarter of an hour before
that time, with his jet-black nose
and watchful eyes pointed in the
direction in which I always came;
and when I approached the steps, he
would leap down and bark like mad,
till the dining-room door was opened,—and
then the front door? And how
he jumped up against my legs, when
I entered, and scampered wildly to
and fro! I know he liked me, and
“no mistake,” as the Great Duke said.
But besides this, I am morally certain
that he always knew the Sunday
morning. Even as early as breakfast-time,
he was grave and restrained,
looking as though he knew that there
was something or other in the wind;
and when we severally went out, he
made no indecent and clamorous
attempts to accompany any of us,
but lay looking solemnly at us, as we
respectively took our departure—and
as soon as we had all gone,
he invariably went up to his bed,
which was under our own, never
stirring till we returned; and who
shall tell what he was thinking
of on such occasions? Did he sleep,
dream? That he does dream, no
one knows better than I; for he
talks—I beg pardon, barks—in his
sleep almost every night, often waking
me from my own dreams. But
what has particularly pleased me in
Tickler is, that when I sit up after
everybody else is gone to bed, he has,
for years, voluntarily remained with
me, however long I may remain. I
wheel an easy-chair (my wife’s) towards
the fire as soon as we are left
alone, he waiting for it quite as a
matter of course, and jumping into
it, immediately turning round, slowly
and thoughtfully, three or four times,
and then settling down into what he
at length, I presume, conceives to be
a comfortable position—his mouth
resting on his paws, and his eyes
fixed on me, till he falls asleep, with
one eye open. Bless his little soul
(for <em>something</em> of that sort he assuredly
has)—how well I recollect
one night, soon after Madame and the
young ones had retired, taking out
of my pocket a hard-hearted and
insulting letter received during the
day—laying it down after reading it,
with a sigh, and then gazing affectionately
at my faithful Tickler,
whose watchful eyes were fixed all
the while on me! Ay, my little
friend! this would try <em>your</em> temper;
but dogs are mercifully spared such
anxieties, although you have your
own sensibilities! In a long series
of years, I have sate up many hours
engaged on my great work, in seventeen
folio volumes, entitled, <cite>The
Essence of Everything from the Beginning</cite>;
and if it please Heaven
to spare my life to finish it, I undertake
that it shall finish the reader.
Well, it has been such a comfort to
me, night after night, every now and
then to watch Tickler watching me,
as I cannot describe; and I do believe
he has contributed, whether
consciously or unconsciously, to divers
fine ideas of mine—at least I
think them fine, and tranquilly await
the judgment of the critics, or such
of them as shall survive to see my
great work, and, above all, survive
the reading of it. How snug he has
made me feel, with my huge easy-chair
exactly opposite his smaller
one (which is my wife’s till she goes
to bed), my table and one or two
chairs covered with books, the crimson
curtain drawn close, and the fire
crackling briskly; many and many
a time have I been inwardly tickled
by seeing and hear him dreaming,
his breathing quickened, and his
bark short and eager, but suppressed.
I am certain that he sometimes has
nightmare! How pleasantly we used
thus to keep one another company in
the winter nights! When my work
was over, often not till two and even
three o’clock in the morning, Tickler
had notice thereof by the act of
shutting up my desk, till which moment
he never stirred; but that done,
and before I had extinguished my
candles, he descended from his chair
in a leisurely way, and yawned and
stretched himself; I often holding
him up by his tail, just to let him feel
that all was right, and that he was
really awake. Then we both crept
up-stairs to bed, as quietly as possible,
lest we should disturb the sleeping
folk. And if I should happen to have
to go down stairs again to look at a
book, or bring up my watch left on
the table, Tickler seemed to feel it his
duty to get out of his snug bed, and
come pattering softly down stairs at
my heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was almost as vivacious as ever,
though twelve summers had passed
over him at the period of that serious
adventure which is presently to be
laid before the admiring reader. But
no amount of vitality has sufficed to
prevent Mr Tickler’s face getting
white; so that, when he is in his
lively humours, he suggests to my
mind the funny face of a frolicsome
little elderly man, or a dog who had
plunged his nose into a flour-bag. I
took him with me last autumn to a
place which I described, but without
specifying, as may be seen in the October
and November numbers of
Maga,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and the trip did him a world
of good. Do you recollect something
that befell me there? viz., that I lost
him for a while, to my grievous discomfiture
and painful exertion—finding
at last that the sweet little rogue
was not lost at all, but squatting
comfortably on our drawing-room
sofa? How little I dreamed, however,
that this might be deemed the
shadow cast before, of a coming event—a
loss of Tickler!! in right earnest?
Only the very midnight before this
startling occurrence he was sitting
in his old place, about twelve o’clock,
opposite to me and the table, whereon
lay a portion of the stupendous
accumulation of MSS., through which
I was patiently distilling off <cite>The
Essence of Everything</cite>. I got up from
my seat and yawned with a sense of
weariness, when he did the very same
thing, and thereby attracted my attention
to him. So I sate down beside
him, and, tickling his ears,
said, “Ah, you little runaway! A
pretty wild-goose chase you led me
at——!” on which he wagged his
tail, and smiled: but no one can
tell a dog’s smile that has not studied
his countenance as I have Tickler’s.
The next morning I lost him in
right earnest—in dreary earnest!
He left our house at 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> on
Monday the 4th December, in company
with a steady middle-aged servant,
almost as much attached to
him as we were ourselves, and who
had come down on an errand to me—but
having left with Tickler, he
arrived at the place where I pass
most of my day-time, without his
better half. “I thought,” said I, on
my arrival, and finding him sitting
in the ante-room, “that you were to
bring Tickler with you, for a walk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I did, sir, but I’ve lost un,
sir, I’m afraid,” he replied stolidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lost Tickler!” I echoed in consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Missed un in a moment,
like, and couldn’t vind un anywhere!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, when did you leave our
house, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as the clock struck ten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now it’s not quite half-past!!
What upon earth were you about not
to stop and look for him?”—Suffice
it to say, that he described himself as
having suddenly missed Tickler, who
had been following as usual close at
his heels, when at only two streets’
distance from our house,—had consumed
five minutes in looking for un—and
then came quietly down without
him, to me! He said he thought
the dog might have returned home
“of his-self! as he had done at ——!”
I was disposed for a while to entertain
a very particular view of this strange
transaction, but in the mean time
sternly despatched the delinquent
back, at top speed, to acquaint our
family with the loss of Tickler; and
also sent a trusty messenger after
him, in the forlorn hope that Tickler
<em>might</em> have returned home “of his-self.”
Nothing of the kind; he was
gone, poor little fellow, in earnest:
and as he wore his collar, with my
name and address in full engraved
thereon, it was plain that unless he
quickly made his appearance, he must
have experienced the professional attentions
of a very vigilant class of
London practitioners. Every member
of my family spent the rest of the
day in scouring the neighbourhood,
especially the more dubious (<em>i. e.</em>, discreditable
or suspicious) portions—but
in vain. Our baker, whom Tickler
used to visit on business every
day, saw him walking past the shopwindow,
alone, and at a leisurely
pace, within about ten minutes of
the time of my servant’s missing
him—but supposed, as a matter of
course, that he was in attendance
upon some member of the family!
Inquiries were made of all our
tradespeople—only to be answered
by exclamations—“What! Tickler
gone? poor little thing, we loved him
like a child!” “He can’t be far away—you’ll
be sure to see him by nighttime,
in particular as he had his collar
with his master’s name;” “and,
ma’am,” added one more sagacious
than the rest, in a mysterious whisper—“if
you don’t—why, in course! he’s
been stole!” “He was the hamiablest
of dogs—so petecler well bred!” “Oh,
you see, Miss! he’ll be sure to come
back!” Then we betook ourselves to
the Police Station; where the courteous
inspector, having listened to us,
said, with a quiet oracular air, “He’s
not far away; he’s taken of course for
the reward, and as he had his collar
on, they know where to find you when
they choose. Is he an old or young
dog?” “He’s in his thirteenth year!”
“Oh, then, you’ll have him back very
soon; the dog-stealers are knowing
fellows, and he won’t do. But take
my advice—advertise him in to-morrow’s
<cite>Times</cite>, and offer only one pound
reward, and be sure to add, no further
reward will be offered.” This we did;
and the next morning appeared the
following public indication of our
calamity, drawn up by my own masterly
pen, and all out of my own
head: “Dog Lost. One Sovereign
Reward. On Monday the 4th inst.,
between —— and ——, a pepper-and-salt
Skye terrier, answering to the
name of Tickler. Collar round his
neck with,” &#38;c. “inscribed on it.
To be brought to that address. No
further reward will be offered.” Having
dropped this our little line into
the huge water of the <cite>Times</cite> advertisement
sheet, we awaited a nibble
with such patience as we could command.
But we got no nibble at all,
and very dull our house seemed, without
our merry and sagacious little
Skye friend. Why, there was not a
room in the house, or a chair or sofa
in it, that did not remind us of him;
and as for my wife’s little easy-chair
opposite mine, when she had gone to
bed, and was no longer succeeded by
Tickler, I wheeled it into the corner
of the room, and did not write at my
<cite>Essence</cite> with anything like my former
satisfaction or spirit. The advertisement
in the <cite>Times</cite> had explained
our disaster to all our friends;
and no one called on us that
did not ask, “Well, any news of
Tickler?” or say, “Poor little fellow,
how you must miss him!” At
length an exceedingly knowing person
came, and said, “Have you been to ——’s?
You can’t do anything without
him; he knows all the respectable
dog-stealers in London, and enjoys
their confidence.” So my wife
and daughter went to him the next
day; and following his advice (given
after a minutely accurate description
of Tickler), I inserted in the particular
newspaper which he said was
likely to be read by the parties concerned,
the following advertisement,
which no false modesty shall prevent
my owning to be, in my opinion, a
choice morsel of expressive pithiness:
“<span class='sc'>Tickler</span>.—One sovereign reward,
<em>and no more</em>, will be paid for
the recovery of a pepper-and-salt Skye
Terrier, answers to the above name,
and lost near ——, on Monday the
4th instant. Had on a collar, with
the words,” &#38;c. &#38;c. “In its 13th
year, and many teeth gone. To be
brought to the above address.” It
grieved me thus to publish to the
world poor Tickler’s age and infirmities;
but needs must, when a certain
Jehu drives:—and the way in which
I vindicated my advertisement against
the reclamations of all Tickler’s
friends was the following: If I show
the thieves that I am quite wide
awake to the poor little dog’s age
and infirmities, it may certainly be
no news to those gentlemen, so experienced
in those matters, but will,
peradventure, add force to the three
pregnant words in italics in the above
advertisement, “<em>and no more</em>.” The
more candid of my opponents said
that there was something in this;
but they held that I had, nevertheless,
greatly hurt Tickler’s feelings,
if ever he came to hear of it. The
more long-headed of my friends went
so far as to say, besides, that it was,
after all, a toss-up whether I ever got
him again!</p>

<p class='c009'>Now comes a remarkable occurrence,
and the reader may depend
upon its being told him exactly as it
occurred, viz., that on my returning
to dinner, one day, a strange Skye
terrier presented himself to me, on
entering our dining-room. He had
followed home two young ladies
in the neighbourhood, who took
him to be our dog, of the loss of
whom they had heard. So they
brought him to us; and on our saying
that it was not Tickler, they left,
followed by the stranger, but refused
to allow him to enter their house.
Now it was a blighty December
afternoon, and this poor <cite>Waif and
Stray</cite> sate outside their door shivering
in the cold: so our servants got
leave to bring the poor thing into our
house, to be taken care of as a sort
of <i><span lang="la">locum-tenens</span></i> of poor Tickler. The
Stranger behaved so well, and had so
many nice little tricks, that we all
were satisfied he was a gentleman’s
or lady’s dog, and we began, in spite
of ourselves, to like him very fast:
for his face reminded us of Tickler a
good deal; but on a more narrow investigation
of Stranger’s pretensions
to our affections, it was discovered
that he was not thorough-bred, as
testified by the mottled roof of his
mouth; and also in respect of his
configuration, he seemed not like a
canine homogeneity, but as it were
two dogs joined together—or rather
a Skye terrier’s head stuck on a
rolled-up door-mat. Still we liked
him, and called him Snap, to which
distinguished name he soon learned
to answer, to our considerable satisfaction,
especially in respect of the
younger folk. Still, he was by no
means Tickler; and besides this, suppose
any of us took him out for a
walk, and the owner should claim his
or her own in a disagreeable kind of
way? and threaten to do by us as
we should have been quite ready to
do by those whom we believed to
have been unconscientiously possessed
of Tickler? These were delicate
matters; and as they impinged on
the dividing line between civil and
criminal responsibility, what more
natural or praiseworthy than that we
should have recourse to our old
friends at the Police Station? Those
to whom we appealed, however, in
this our little quandary, seemed
qualified to be Under-Secretaries of
State, in respect of a prodigious apparent
sense of responsibility, and a
certain flatulent incertitude. They
humm’d and ha’d, and finally said
that we had better do as we thought
best, for that we must be too respectable
to be supposed to be dog-stealers;
however, they said they
would send some one to us in the
evening “to give us directions.”
But by that time the following state
of things had come to pass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, papa!” said one of my children,
on my knocking at the door in
the evening, “news of Tickler!”
“News of Tickler? Pho!” I exclaimed,
half hopefully, however.
“But there really is!—A man came
here at six o’clock, and says that he
really thinks he has heard of a dog
that must be ours!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he, indeed? Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He says that, from what people
have told him, the dog he found
some time ago wandering about the
suburbs, must most likely be ours!
But he’ll call again at half-past seven
o’clock.” So, in short, and in due
time, we sate down to dinner; I indulging
in sundry surmises concerning
the probability of our mysterious
friend paying us his promised visit.
And while we sate at table, the following
titillating story was told us,
as touching the subject of dogs, then
uppermost in our thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>A certain celebrated painter of
animals as they never were painted
before, and may never be painted
again, had painted the portrait of a
splendid Newfoundland dog, but he
strayed or was stolen as he was returning
from his last sitting. His
owner was inconsolable; but, knowing
the distinguished artist’s large
and intimate acquaintance with persons
who confidentially concern themselves
with other people’s dogs, repaired
to him for advice, and authorised
him of the magnificent palette
to offer ten pounds reward for the recovery
of the missing favourite. The
artist soon put himself into communication
with one of his private friends,
who asked him what kind of dog it
was? “Why,” says the artist, “look
here; this is his picture: should you
know him again?” The fellow gazed
at the vividly faithful representation
for a minute or two intently, and then
said, “I thinks I’se got him now; I
shall know him if I see him. But
what’s the tip?” “Ten pounds.”
“Werry ansome, indeed, and worth
a little trouble; but such a prime
hanimal as that ’ere will cost a deal
of trouble to get hold on, such uncommon
care is taked on ’em by them
as has got ’em. Howse’er, I’ll do my
best;” and again he glued his eyes
on the pictured dog, and then withdrew.
A month elapsed without tidings
of the missing Ten Pounder;
but at length, in the dusk of the
evening, the great artist was summoned
into his painting-room, and
there found his confidential agent.
“Well, Bill,” quoth the former, “any
news about the dog? I have given it
up.” “O no, don’t, sir,” was the
reply, with a wink. “I do <em>rally</em>
b’lieve I’ve got him at last. But is
the tip all safe still, and no mistake?”
“Ay—have it anyway you like.”
“It an’t a check” asked his astute
companion. “No—a ten-pound note,
two fives, or sovereigns.” “Well—and
no questions an’t to be asked?
lest I should get any friends into
trouble?” “Only you bring the
dog, my man, and you take the
money, and all’s done for ever. Honour!”
“Well, sir, where that word’s
said by a gent, there’s an end of
everything; so the dog will be here
in half-an-hour’s time, and a pretty
business I’ve had to find him.”
Half-an-hour’s lapse saw this little
stroke of business complete, and dog
and cash exchanged. “Well now,
my man,” said the artist, “and it’s
all over, though I said I wouldn’t
ask you a question, I can’t help it,
merely out of curiosity. I give you
my honour that I have no other
motive, and will take no steps at all,
in consequence of what you may tell
me. Did I ever deceive you?” “No,
sir, you never did.” “Well—do you
know who stole him?” “Quite sure
you won’t do nothing if I tell you?”
“Honour—honour!” “Well, sir, I
was the chap as prigg’d him.” “<em>You!</em>”—echoed
the artist with expanded
eyes, uplifted hands, and a great
start. “Yes, me, sir. I took’d the
dog, and no mistake.” “Whew!—Well—but
now I’m more curious
still to know why you chose to be
so long out of your money—your ten
pounds? Why not have brought him
back in a few days and got your £10
at once?” “’Cos, sir, you see, I
sold un to another party for seven
pounds, who took such a liking to
the creature, that I hadn’t the heart
to steal un from him, till he’d had a
week or two’s comfort out on him;
but as soon as he had, I know’d how
to prig the dog. I, as could do it once,
could do it twice—and now you’ve
got what you want; but it sartinly
sounds coorious, don’t it?” “Why
you consummate scamp,” quoth the
artist, almost splitting with laughter—“you’ve
got seventeen pounds
out of the dog!!” “Yes, sir, that’s
the figure, exact,” replied the stolid
Man of Dogs. “Well, but, you impudent
vagabond—if you could prig
a dog, as you say, once, and twice,
you may <em>thrice</em>——” “Well, sir, so
I may—but this here dog will be
looked arter unkimmin close <em>now</em>,
and I shan’t run no risk.” “Well,
honour among thieves—eh?” “Quite
correct, sir,” quoth κυνοκλεπτης.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were laughing at this story, as
we sate at dinner, when a single knock
came to the front door—and in a trice
our servant, the unhappy cause of all
our sorrows, whisked out of the room,
opened the Hall door, and after a hasty
colloquy returned. “He’s come, sir!—the
man about Tickler, sir,” said
he, re-entering the room, excitedly.
In a trice I was in the Hall, followed
by my two sons and the servant.
My visitor stood, his cap squared in
his hands, in the angle formed by the
side of the Hall and the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my man, do you really
know anything about my dog?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, sir,” he answered, very respectfully,
“I think I do; it must be
the same dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sort of a dog is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Hile of Skye terrier, sir—pepper-and-salt,
and rather white about
the mouth, and a many teeth gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well; but does he answer to the
name of Tickler?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t say, sir, really. Haven’t
seen him myself, sir; only my friend
as found him wandering about, a good
way off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! haven’t you seen the advertisement
in which he’s called
Tickler?” Here was a moment’s
embarrassing pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, can’t say I have; but
maybe my friend has.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, do you mean to say that
you’ve never heard him called Tickler?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never see’d him, sir; and never
heard the name Tickler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! not in the advertisement?”
At this moment a heavy single knock
at the door, against which I was
leaning, made me start. I opened it,
and a policeman stood there. “Is
the inspector come, sir?” he asked.
My friend in the corner was instantly
aghast, and seemed in the act of
squeezing himself into the wall (to
avoid being seen by the grizzly visitor),
his eyes fixed on me with an
expression I shall not soon forget.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; and you may tell him he
need not come now. I am much
obliged to you both; but I now don’t
want to part with the dog.” The
policeman bowed, descended the steps,
and I shut the door. This visit had
been paid us in consequence of our
application to the station-house for
advice how to dispose of Snap. My
visitor had grown considerably whiter
than so much as was visible of his
shirt!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be under any apprehension,
my man,” said I, with a smile; “it
is certainly one of the oddest coincidences
I ever saw; but I pledge my
word to you that it is purely accidental,
and in no way relates to you
or my own dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O no,” he exclaimed, with yet a
scared and distrustful look; “in
coorse you knew it couldn’t consarn
me anyhow, ’cause I an’t done nothing
wrong, I know; but it sartinly
looked werry peticlar funny, didn’t
it now, sir?” wiping his forehead;
“but when a gent gives his word, I
believe him, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, but about <em>my</em> dog; you’ve
never seen him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never set these blessed eyes on
him yet, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come, my man,” I said,
good-naturedly, “I have acted honourably
by you, and do you so with
me. I pledge my word that no harm
shall come to you through me. Now
tell me—you <em>have</em> seen Tickler!” I
added, so suddenly that I took him
off his guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir, you speak so werry
ansome—I <em>have</em> seen the dog, and I
an’t no manner of doubt it’s your’n.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His collar on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he han’t got any collar on
<em>now</em>—least wise, when I picked him
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I thought you told me your
friend picked him up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I indeed? Well pra’ps he
did—but there an’t no collar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, as to the Reward—you saw
the advertisement offered only a sovereign?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, yes sir, that’s quite correct—”
forgetting that he had <em>not</em> seen it—“but
I expect to be paid for my
two walks up here to-night, sir,
beside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what do you expect? I’ll
give you half-a-crown.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, no, <em>that</em> won’t do,” he interrupted
me peremptorily—“I always has
a five-shilling tip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always!!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir—quite regular—ahem!”
he suddenly stopped, as though he
had caught a glimmering of having
committed himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the dog die then, sir,” I said
sternly, opening the door for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, poor thing!—if it’s
your’n, which I’m sartin it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I suppose I must pay it
you!—That will be £1, 5s.?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite correct sir—and if you’ll
let your man come with me, I’ll give
him the dog, after he’s given me the
money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the dog must be present before
he gives you the money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, yes, sir—all right—but all’s
quite <em>honour</em> in such things as these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How soon will the dog be here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In less than an hour, sir.” With
this I directed all three—my two sons
and the servant, to put on their
greatcoats, and accompany him; first
whispering a hint to leave watches
behind. After they had been gone
five minutes, the servant returned,
saying that the man had advised him
not to go, as <em>three</em> beside himself
looked so suspicious-like, and might
prevent us getting the dog. My two
sons accompanied their honourable
companion till he had got them into
Drury Lane! And there he dodged
them about, up and down, and in and
out of court after court, and alley
after alley, till they had reached a
very little dirty public-house, into
the parlour of which their guide conducted
his two companions. Such a
parlour! about six feet square, and
reeking with odours of gin and tobacco
smoke. Another gentleman
was sitting there, who had just been
discharged out of prison, he said—“And
it wasn’t unlikely he might be
in again soon, for something or other—for
he <em>must</em> live!” He was giving
a very lively account of prison life,
when my son’s companion returned—after
a ten minutes’ absence—with—Tickler!
the true identical dear old
Tickler, and no mistake whatever
about it! But—instead of rushing
up to his former patrons and playfellows,
he came into the room timidly,
and, strange to say, seemed disposed
to make the acquaintance of two cats
who were in the room, and who
seemed quite at home with a dog.
When called by his name, he hardly
noticed it, and seemed to have forgotten
my sons, or to feel no particular
interest in them! The money
having been given, my sons took poor
Tickler in their arms for safety’s
sake, quitted the vilest neighbourhood
they had ever been in, and carried
him nearly all the way home—which
he reached in half-an-hour’s
time. We were on the look-out at
the windows for the poor little fellow—and
the moment we saw him,
I rushed to the door and opened it,
just as Tickler came up the steps;
but there stood Snap also—having
run up suddenly from the kitchen,
whither he had been relegated by my
orders, to prevent his encountering
Tickler—who, however, immediately
spoke to his <i><span lang="la">locum-tenens</span></i> in a quiet
friendly way. Then the latter was
carried down bodily into the kitchen,
and Tickler whisked into his old
quarters in the dining-room. We resolved
to take matters very quietly,
having been told that dogs had been
known to die of joyful excitement
under such circumstances. So we
all took our seats, eyeing his movements.
He ran rapidly to and fro
about the room—under the sofa, the
tables, the sideboard, as if his scent
were gradually reviving old recollections
and associations. Then he began
to moan, or whine, piteously, but
in a very low tone; and finding a
little bone which had been left by
Snap, he seized on it ravenously. On
this we ordered him up a little meat;
and, in the mean time, he stood up
against each of our chairs, moaning
while he looked into our faces, and
trembling. “Tickler! Tickler! dear
old Tickler, how are you?” quoth I,
gently; on which he trembled, looked
sorrowfully in my face, and wagged
his tail slowly. To aid him in recollecting
himself, I resorted to one of
my old habits with him—viz. lifting
him up gently by his fore-paws; but
I almost let him fall again, with concern;
for the poor little fellow seemed
not half his former weight! And
when I felt his backbone, how sharp
and bare it was!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Tickler! what have they been
doing with you?” said I. His whine
told of starvation. He seemed indeed
perfectly blighted: and when we all
went up to bed, I following after
a little interval with Tickler, it gave
me pain to observe the want of his
old elasticity in going up-stairs. He
was evidently thin and weak. The
next day I was anxious to hear his
adventures; but I knew that he felt
embarrassed if required to speak in
the presence of any one beside myself:
so I waited till I had a favourable
opportunity, which occurred on
the next night but one. About an
hour after all except myself had
ascended to their respective dormitories,
and when I was busy distilling
off <cite>The Essence of Everything</cite>, Tickler,
who had been lying curled round
himself, so to speak, in his usual
fashion, suddenly rose, shook himself,
and in a sitting posture, thus
addressed me.</p>

<p class='c009'>—But his adventures (for I had
asked him to tell them to me) were
far too interesting and affecting for
me to give them to the world at
large, before affording him an opportunity
of hearing me read them to
him for his correction. That I shall
do, and then let the reader form his
own judgment—next month:—but I
feel it a point of honour to impress
upon the reader that he is to make
no attempt to identify persons or
localities!</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE DRAMA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sir Andrew Agnew may have
been a very good man, but he never
said more than one good thing—if
even that is original. In one of his
letters he characterises the wit of the
three kingdoms as follows: The
Scotch play upon the feelings, the
Irish play upon ideas, the English
play upon words. The distribution
is clever and very plausible, if not
altogether true. It is correct enough,
we believe, as far as regards the
Scotch. There is little wit, but a
great deal of humour in their fun;
and wherever there is wit, almost
always it manifests itself in union
with strong feeling of some kind—is
at one time sarcastic, at another time
profane. A Scotchman seldom indulges
in pure wit—takes no especial
interest in a purely intellectual, or a
purely auricular surprise. His logical
habits unfit him for that confusion of
ideas which Sir Andrew attributes to
the Irish, and disincline him for that
confusion of words which he attributes
to the English jesters. It is
with reference to these last that his
division is most at fault, and it is
also at fault with regard to the Irish.
An immense number of Hibernian
witticisms, it is true, are to be classed
with those Yankee and negro sayings,
of which the point depends on
a singular confusion of ideas, and of
which the following may be taken as
typical examples: “Pompey and
Cæsar very much like, ’specially Pompey;”—“Uncle
was so tall that he had
to mount a ladder every day to put on
his hat.” A practical instance of the
same kind is the story of the Irishman
who cut a great hole in his
door for the sow to pass through, and
a little one beside it for the sucking-pigs.
But this very confusion of
ideas is so apt to express itself in a
contradiction of terms, that the wit for
which Paddy is celebrated all over
the world is known as an Irish bull;
and an Irish bull is as much a
verbal play as an English pun. The
difference between them may be
stated thus loosely: In a bull, the
double meanings are incompatible
and contradictory; in a pun, they
blend together, and do not interfere
with each other, except in the way of
curious comparison or odd contrast.
Now, although perhaps no people
have such an inveterate habit of punning
and quibbling as the English, it
is not true that this is the great
characteristic of their wit. With all
the reputation which they have on
the Continent for melancholy, with
all that tone of sadness which pervades
their poetry, no people have
ever displayed such a hearty enjoyment
of fun as the English, and no
other comedy has such a wide range
as theirs. It contains every variety
of humour and every variety of
wit. And however much we may
despise puns, they have often been
used as the expression of profoundest
feeling by men of the largest
grasp. Shakespeare is an example;
his range of comicality is greater
than that of any other writer in
the language, and he puts puns
into the mouths of his heroes and
heroines, even in the moment of
maddest passion. Thomas Fuller is
another instance of a man of deep
sympathies and earnest views, who
gave expression to these sentiments
in what we are accustomed to regard as
the most trivial and equivocal of forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while Sir Andrew Agnew’s
definition of English wit is extremely
partial, it has certainly at this season
of the year the appearance of conveying
the whole truth. The puns are as
thick in a Christmas pantomime as
plums in a Christmas pudding. They
come out at this time of the year as
naturally as berries on the holly; and
whoever means to enjoy the season
must accept it all, quips and quibbles,
puns and buns, the light fantastic toe
at night, and the headache next morning.
Of what avail is it to shake
one’s head over the mince-pies, to tell
that young savage, Mr Tommy, that
he has eaten too many raisins, to
look dismal over another glass of
champagne? It is all right; digestion
will come in its own good time;
and what is the use of Christmas if
one cannot once in a year dismiss all
thoughts of the doctor and his senna?
What is the use of Christmas, too, if
theatrical managers cannot for once
in a year snap their fingers at the
critic and his nauseous doses? On
boxing-night comes the pantomime,
all paint and spangles, scenery and
machinery, fooling and pulling about;
it is the reign of good-humour; clown
grins from ear to ear; pantaloon takes
all the buffets he gets with the greatest
pleasure; while the manager is
as obstreperous as the one, and the
critics are as delighted with his hard
hits as the other. The fact is, and
there is no denying it, that the pantomime,
and all that it includes of burlesque
and extravaganza, is at present
the great glory of the British drama.
The drama has all gone to pot (the
paint-pot), and out of it has arisen
rollicking pantomime, even as out of
the caldron of Medea, what went in
an old ram came out a young lamb.
That this young lamb is the pride of
the British stage at the present time,
will be evident to any one who enters
a theatre. No chance of getting a
seat, even in the larger houses, if you
happen to be half-an-hour late. And
not only are the houses crammed, the
audience is different from the usual
audiences. There is a prim old lady,
with a pursed-up mouth, in the boxes,
whose presence is accounted for by
the fact that there are two fairies at
her side, who are as much in love
with Clown as ever Titania was with
Bottom. Everybody who looks at
the stalls knows that the bald-headed
old gentleman with the capacious
waistcoat is “the father of a family,”
even were there no long lines of
children on either side of him. And
will it be believed that through the
curtain of the private box there is
peering, with his ivory opera-glass to
his eyes, that long-faced Grimshaw,
who never enters a theatre—never—and
who never perpetrated a joke
but once, when he quite seriously compared
the pit to the pit of Acheron,
and wondered that when people saw
written up, “The way to the pit,”
they did not take fright, and vow
never again to enter a playhouse?
Everybody goes to the pantomime.
It is the only successful effort of the
British drama. Tragedy has become
so very tragic that she has cut her
own throat; comedy has been so
very comical that she has choked
herself with laughing; and burlesque
comes up like a demon through the
trap to supply the place of the one,
pantomime comes tumbling in head-over-heels
to supply the place of the
other. Every one has his day: Shakespeare
has gone out; Planché has
come in. Let no one accuse us of
treason to “the divine William,” as
Dumas calls him, when we say that
Planché is a kind of Shakespeare. He
is precisely such a Shakespeare as
entered into Dr Johnson’s imagination
when he said, “A quibble was to
him the fatal Cleopatra for which
he lost the world, and was content to
lose it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be confessed that although
most of Mr Planché’s extravaganzas
are published, there is not one of
them that is readable. They are
meant to be acted, not read. Effervescing
from the mouth of the performers,
and eked out with look and
gesture, scenic effect and musical
rubadub, the galleries make a vociferous
noise, and the boxes make a
magnificent show of teeth. Now it
is some pun which has been lying in
wait from the beginning of the scene,
now some extraordinary rhyme which
seemed as difficult to match as Cinderella’s
glass slipper, now an allusion
to the events of the day, now the
sudden falling into slang in the
midst of some high-flown language.</p>

in the parody of <cite>Shylock</cite>—the <cite>Jerusalem

effects, making the glitter pass for
gold, the trash for truth, the bad
grammar for good sense, and the
abortive pun for pointed wit. Give
us good puns by all means, if there is
nothing better to be had, and we shall
laugh at them; but save us from word-torture
as incomprehensible, dull, and
valueless as the anagrams which used
to puzzle and amuse our ancestors.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>at least such punning as we have
quoted. If we are asked to define
legitimate punning, take an example
from <cite>Punch</cite>, who sums up his metaphysics
in the following queries and
answers:—“What is matter? Never
mind.—What is mind? No matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If any one wishes a defence of
punning, we must refer him to the
Germans, and especially to Herman
Ulrici, who thus discourses on the
quibbles of our great English dramatist:
“If, then, we go back to the
origin of this verbal play, and further
reflect that Shakespeare never
kept up this game of rejoinder and
antithesis emptily and unmeaningly,
but that with him it has always some
meaning, and <em>not unfrequently a most
profound significance</em>, we shall see
good reason for the whole representation
being pervaded by it. For in this
discrepancy between the indicated
matter and its indication, and the appropriateness
of the same or similar
words to express wholly different objects,
we have the revelation of the deep
fundamental and original disagreement
between human life and its
true idea; as well as the inadequacy
of human cognition and knowledge
of which language is the expression,
for the wide range of objective truth
and reality, and consequently of the
weakness entailed upon man’s noblest
intellectual power by the Fall and the
first lie.” So that puns are the result
of the Fall, and the fruit of the forbidden
tree. Horrible thought for Mr
‘A Beckett—puns impossible in paradise!
Without, however, going to the
profundities of Ulrici, we have to
point out the propriety of this style
of wit in the peculiar species of drama
which it adorns. A pun is on a small
scale what parody is on a large. Accept
the burlesque drama wholesale,
and there is no reason why one
should object to the quibbling in detail.
It is consistent throughout.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Olympic is the theatre in
which Planché appears to the greatest
advantage—the intensity of which
Robson is capable, giving a force to
the representation with which all the
brilliance and gaiety of the old Lyceum
spectacle are not to be compared.
It is one of the two best
theatres in London, in which one is
always sure of good and finished acting—the
wayward humours of Robson
being in fine contrast with the
sustained art of Wigan. Than the
latter there is not a more accomplished
actor on the stage; he really acts;
and it is a high intellectual treat,
which one does not often nowadays
enjoy, to see how with successive
touches he works out a character, or
graduates a passion with a delicacy
of detail that is not more marvellous
than the consistency of tone throughout.
As Wigan satisfies the lover of
intellectual enjoyment, Robson satisfies
the craving for excitement; the
one is perfect art, the other perfect
nature. Perfect nature in burlesque—impossible!
It is possible, however,
with Robson. Usually burlesque
acting is the most unnatural
thing in the world; no single passion
or state is represented truly; every
word, every tone, every look is false.
With Robson, however, every tone is
true, every look is nature; it is in
the jumble and juxtaposition of details
that his burlesque consists, in
suddenly passing from the extreme of
anger or fear to the extreme of
humorous ease, in suddenly relapsing
into vulgar slang in mid-volley
of the most passionate speech, and
all with the most marvellous flexibility
of voice and feature. Presto!
faster than we can follow him, he has
changed from grave to gay, from
lively to severe. The <cite>Yellow Dwarf</cite>
of last year was probably his greatest
effort, although <cite>Prince Richcraft</cite> of
the present season is not far behind.
It has a mad scene which is equal to
anything he has ever personated.
The story it is needless to recapitulate—it
is taken from the collection
of <cite>Mother Goose</cite>. They are all nearly
alike. There is sure to be a prince
or princess in disguise; a good fairy
and a bad one; an army extravagantly
armed, murders by the
score, magical fruit or something
else, a strange discovery, and the
prince and princess married at last,
in spite of the villain, all his wiles
and all his passion. A strange life it
is, that pictured in the fairy tales
which are worked up into these extravaganzas,—a
life in which trap-doors
and invisible springs are as essential
as patent-leather boots and
gibus hats are to us, in which there
is always a gutta-percha eagle that
comes flying with a necessary key in
its claw, and fish are poking their
gills out of still lakes with lost rings
in their mouths, a purse of gold lies
on the ground just when it is wanted,
beautiful witches in red-heeled shoes
come hobbling down to the footlights;
and in the last tableau of all, there
are all the fairies in their fairy palace
standing pyramidally one above the
other. As in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> the
characters are always asking each
other to tell tales—lives are saved
by stories well told—and one gathers
that the thread of Arabian existence
is one long yarn; so, in the extravaganzas,
songs are all the rage,—the
enchanter sings his victim to sleep,
the princess wins her lover by the
charm of her voice,—the lover serenades
his mistress; the king must be
amused, and his only amusement is
“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter.” Music
is not only the food of love, but the
blue-pill also; and it is the food and
the blue-pill of every other feeling as
well. There is another characteristic
feature of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> which
is prominently exhibited in the extravaganzas—the
disregard of life.
Murder is a mild word for the destructiveness
of the kings—they literally
massacre all around: it is the
dance of death. But let no one confound
all this murder and massacre
with the similar tendencies in the
low gallows-literature of the present
time. All the murdering of the fairy
tales is counterbalanced by the effect
of the slaughter. The victims are
scarcely ever killed outright—they
are instantly transformed, they start
up and fly away in some new shape.
The idea of death as annihilation
never enters into the fairy tales; all
is immortal: murder is but the
plucking of a flower that will grow
again; the massacre of a village is
only a series of dissolving views.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Olympic is the only theatre
without a harlequinade attached to
its fairy tale. For tricks of clown
and pantaloon one naturally travels
to Covent Garden and the adjacent
theatres. Who shall describe all the
nonsense and merriment that passes
current in these temples of the Muse?
Puns, puns, nothing but puns—and
such rough practical joking as the
youth of England delights in! What
an immense deal of laughter they
manage to get out of that part of the
body in which angels are said to be
deficient.  It is kicked, pins are
stuck into it as into a convenient
pin-cushion; Clown puts a live lobster
into his comprehensive pockets, and
jumps up with fearful grimaces.
Then what pulling of noses; how
they are flattened, how they are
lengthened, how they are blackened
with soot, how they are filled with
snuff till the poor member sneezes
and bleeds! And how the little fellows
in the boxes laugh and crow
over the practical jokes! It is such
rare fun to see Clown stumble over a
baby, and crush its head like a pancake,
and double it up into the
cradle. O glorious to see a shopkeeper’s
window smashed, and his
coat torn off his back; to see Clown
burning the potatoes and licking the
roast, and throwing carrots and turnips
about the stage; to see Pantaloon
pitched into the pot, and turning
out a plum-pudding; to see Clown’s
head cut off, and the body running
headless about the stage, the head
crying out for the body,—glued on to
the shoulder, and so happily united
that Clown takes a leap through a
window, and tumbles back as well as
ever through the grating below; to
see the sucking-pig running about,
and given to the nurse instead of her
lost child; to see Clown for all his
iniquities put into a great gun, with
lots of powder, and shot to perdition,
next hanging like a caitiff from the
top of the theatre, and suddenly
flopping down on the devoted heads
of first and second fiddle in the
orchestra. Hip, hip! away, you little
wicked-eyed younkers, and when you
go home put the poker in the fire,
Master Jacky, turn in your small
toes, and with your redhot plaything
burn holes in the tails of papa’s coat,
while Sarah Jane dances about in all
the ecstasy of Columbine.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is not much interest in going
minutely over the theatres, and recording
all the peculiarities of treatment.
At Covent Garden the preliminary
burlesque is the best subject
that can be imagined— <cite>Y<sup>e</sup> Belle
Alliance</cite>, but it is very poorly treated.
The most remarkable thing about the
pantomime is the curtain. What is
that, most gentle reader? An immense
advertisement sheet, in which
Mechi, and Moses, and Madame
Tussaud, and all the notorious puffers,
dazzle the eye of the spectators, with
magic strops and wonders of cheapness,
until the curtain rises on the
usual trickery of the evening.
“Shilling razors”—“Whiskers in
five minutes”—“Baking powder”—“Who’s
your glover?”—“Look to
your legs”—“Gentlemen’s hair dyed in
half-an-hour, ladies’ in an hour”—“Caspiato,
or the folding bonnet; to
fold in a box two inches deep”—“The
Teflis silk umbrella,” and all the chicanery
of Sheffield and Brummagem
wares;—these are the objects of contemplation
that, as a kind of mercantile
prelude, in which the auctioneer’s
hammer and the chinking of coin are
the principal instruments, are intended
to prepare the mind for the more
honest arts of harlequin and pantaloon.
Let us go to Drury Lane, the
lessee of which is a man who seems
anxious to be regarded as the English
Barnum, and who probably, like his
American prototype, would accept it
as the greatest of compliments were
we to describe him as the most perfect
humbug in London. Jenny
Lind, the Feejee mermaid, and the
woolly horse, were all the same to
Barnum. The African twins, Vauxhall
Gardens, the cage of lions,
Charles Mathews, or Miss Glyn—it
is all the same to E. T. Smith. His
great guns for the present are Charles
Mathews and Tom Matthews. The
<cite>Great Gun-Trick</cite>, of which the former
is the life and soul, appearing as Professor
Mathews, the wizard of the
S.S.W. by S., is a really clever little
piece, happy in idea, brilliant in execution,
and worthy of all its success.
The pantomime, <cite>Hey, diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle</cite>, is all fiddlededee.
Tom Matthews, the clown, plays
the deuce with the tea and the pale
ale, and when Jim and Jerry go to
the public-house hard by, with the
name of Tom Matthews above it, and
his picture as merry-andrew above
that, don’t they expect to see a red-and-white
face peeping from the back
shop, and wonder what sort of a man
Mr Clown is at home, and what sort
of fourpenny he can recommend?
Pass down the Strand to the Adelphi.
There is an audience on the most
friendly terms with the performers,
an unsophisticated audience, that
roars and screams, and thoroughly
enjoys. When Wright takes off his
hat, how they laugh; when he puts
it on a chair, how they scream; when
he sits on it, what convulsions! The
peculiarity of the pantomime here is,
that Madame Celeste appears as harlequin.
She goes through the performance
with marvellous agility,
but, on the whole, one could wish that
in this case the cap of harlequin had
really the power of rendering the
wearer invisible. At the Haymarket,
Mr Buckstone has turned his attention
to entomology, and given us
<cite>The Butterfly’s Ball and the Grasshopper’s
Feast</cite>. He has succeeded in
overcoming our antipathy to insects,
in teaching us to endure wasps, negotiate
with fleas, hobanob with spiders,
and flirt with flies. If the Haymarket
is entomological, Sadler’s
Wells is decidedly feline, and the
Princess’s partly feline, partly canine,
partly ornithological. The latter is
without doubt the best pantomime of
the year—the best in idea, the best
put upon the stage. It is impossible
to give an idea of it without going
more into detail than we can afford.
The introduction is supposed to take
place partly in the land of birds and
partly in the isle of beasts; the canaries
and humming-birds are afraid of
the cats, and the story of the Maid
and the Magpie is interweaved with
the hopes and fears of the bright-plumed
birds and the gigantic grimalkins,
that play and roll over each
other like veritable kittens on the
hearth-rug. Then, in the harlequinade,
we have the <i><span lang="fr">pas des parachutes</span></i>
by the young ladies, who come upon
the stage—how? dropping from the
clouds; the gymnastic feats of Mr
Tanner’s wonderful dogs, who poise
themselves on barrels and dance on
their heads as nimbly as clown in the
sawdust of the circus; and best of
all, the representation of the banquet
in <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> by a troop of children,
the little bluff King Hal making
love to a diminutive Anne Bulleyn,
a miniature Queen Kate scratching
the face and tearing the eyes of
her maid of honour in a way that
would have shocked Shakespeare not
less than Dr Watts, who declares that
little hands were never made for such
a purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess’s Theatre ought to
produce the best pantomime, for it is
the theatre of all others which pays
most attention to stage effect; and it
would be strange, if, eclipsing all
others in the illustration of the Shakespearean
drama, it should be behindhand
in the representation of its pantomime.
It is no vulgar brilliance of
scenery, no clap-trap effects of green,
red, and gold without meaning, that
Mr Charles Kean introduces to his
audience. There is always something
striking, something to remember,
something wholly original and highly
suggestive, sometimes even poetical,
in his scenic effect. Take the angel
tableau in <cite>Faust</cite> and <cite>Marguerite</cite>,
which is substantially the same as in
the dying vision of Queen Katherine,
what a fine solemn effect it had in
feeling, how pure and beautiful it
looked as a picture, and, last of all,
how cleverly managed as a mere mechanical
contrivance—the angels sliding
down without any visible support.
Or take the banquet scene in <cite>Henry
VIII.</cite>; there was a marvellous originality
in the point of view from which
the banquet-hall was seen. It was
represented slanting up the stage, so
that the spectators were supposed to
stand, not at the end, but at the corner
of it. There is a picture in the
window of every printshop, in which
the Duke of Wellington is represented
feasting his Waterloo comrades,
and which is drawn from a similar
point of view. Make the slant greater,
cut the table off in the middle by the
side-scenes or the picture-frame, and
we have the suggestion of a room of
illimitable extent. Compare this
imaginative mode of suggesting a
great space, with the vulgar method
adopted in Drury Lane, where, in
the absurd procession of idols that
ended Fitzball’s Egyptian monster of
a play, the stage was thrown open to
the back wall, and one looked at a
stream of cats, rats, and crocodiles,
coming down a small street. The
scenery and upholstery of Mr Charles
Kean, it is true, are very much decried
by certain writers, and are continually
brought forward as evidences
of the low estate of the drama.
These writers, however, seem to
speak with a personal feeling against
the manager of the Princess’s, and
with very little knowledge of the
history of the drama. And on these
two points, the present low estate of
the theatre and Mr Kean’s share in
that degradation, we have a few remarks
to make. Praise it or blame
it—the tendency to scenic illustration
is the characteristic of the British
theatre in its latest development, and
rightly to understand its intention, is
rightly to comprehend the position of
our modern drama.</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to the present decline
of the drama, we must point out that
in its entire history there never has
been a time when it has not been
exposed to the severest condemnation
which our language is capable of expressing.
It has always been giving
up the ghost, always dead, or worthy
of death. Shakespeare began to
write for the stage in 1589. Exactly
ten years before was published the
earliest diatribe against the stage, at
least the earliest of importance:—“The
School of Abuse: containing
a pleasant invective against Poets,
Pipers, Players, Jesters, and suchlike
Caterpillars of a Commonwealth: setting
up the flag of defiance to their
mischievous exercise, and overthrowing
their bulwarks, by profane writers,
natural reason, and common experience:
a discourse as pleasant for
gentlemen that favour learning, as
profitable for all that will follow
virtue. By Stephen Gosson.” After
Gosson came Philip Stubbes, then
Rankins, then Rainolds; then <cite>Histriomastin</cite>,
the play: and many years
afterwards, the still more celebrated
<cite>Histriomastin</cite> of William Prynne,
which took the author seven years to
compose, and four years more to pass
through the press. These attacks
were levelled against the licentiousness
of the stage; had in view the
suppression, rather than the reformation,
of the theatres; and were so far
successful that for a period of years,
in which the drama suffered greater
comparative injury than has ever
since or was ever before inflicted on
it, the acting of plays was entirely
prohibited. So great was the injury
inflicted that from this time forward—from
the reopening of the playhouses
under Charles II. to the present
hour—the cry has never ceased
to be heard that the British drama
is either dead or dying. All manner
of changes have been rung upon it.
At one time, amid the unparalleled
licentiousness of Wycherley and Congreve,
Vanbrugh and Farquhar, when
a hard heart was the best flint for
wit to sparkle from, and a hardened
conscience the best steel to make it
sparkle, the conclusion was drawn
quite logically that artistic degradation
is the inevitable accompaniment
of such moral debasement, the sensual
inhuman spirit tending to destroy
that power of sympathy which
is the fountainhead of dramatic inspiration.
Then when the Italian
opera came into vogue, and the fashionables
of London turned a ready
ear to the poetry of an unknown
language, it was declared (by Sir
Richard Steele, if we remember
rightly, or at all events in the epilogue
to one of his plays) that the
English, who had eschewed Popery
in religion, were hankering after
Popery in wit;  and loud and many
were the warnings raised against the
growing apostasy. Again, when the
vein of native talent seemed to have
been exhausted, and almost every
piece that could boast of the slightest
success had a plot borrowed from
the Spanish, and sentiment borrowed
from the French, refugee characters
and the refuse of foreign wit, how
bitterly was it lamented that so
wealthy an heiress, and so beautiful,
as the muse of the British drama,
having squandered her dowry and
prostituted her gifts to ignoble ends,
should thus at length be driven forth
in penury to live on alien charity,
and perhaps, like another Jane Shore,
to end a wretched existence begging
on the highways and byways of literature?
At a later period, the ignominious
demise of the British muse
was expected with still greater certainty,
when the play-wrights seemed
to have forgotten even the art of forging
clever imitations, seemed to have
lost even the Spartan talent of clever
plagiarism, and their highest achievements
were avowedly translated from
Kotzebue and other Germans. And
afterwards, when some of the poets
who adorned the early part of the
present century—Coleridge, Maturin,
Milman—surrounding as it were the
deathbed of the old lady, did their
best to keep her in life, critical doctors
shook their heads and shrugged
their shoulders as if the labour were
useless, and but a prolonging of the
last inevitable agonies of a toothless,
palsied, miserable old beldame, that
had better die than live. She has
not yet given up the ghost, however,
nor is likely to do so in a hurry.
Nevertheless the symptoms of dissatisfaction,
so far from being silenced,
are more frequent and doleful
than ever, and are now directed not
only against the dramatists, but also
against the actors, there being no
doubt that, to whatever cause it may
be owing (probably it is very much
due to that commonly assigned, the
abolition of theatrical monopoly,
which has distributed amongst a
number of companies the histrionic
talent formerly concentrated in two),
it is extremely difficult to secure for
a comedy, and almost impossible to
secure for the highest tragedy, a
strong and thoroughly good cast, so
that from the protagonist down to
the meanest performer every part is
well fitted, and the result on the
stage, with all the accompaniments
of costume, scenery, and music, is a
perfect whole, a true work of art.
When, partly on this account—namely,
the inefficiency of the actors—but
partly also through a tendency
which is inherent in all art, Mr
Macready and other managers after
him paid extraordinary attention to
the dressing of the stage, so that
cases have occurred, on the representation
of a new piece, of the
audience calling before the curtain,
not the author who planned the
whole of it, not the manager who
brought it effectually to light, not
the actors who stood forward as the
chief interpreters of the play, but the
scenic artist who, with his paint-pots
and his Dutch foil, his muslin waterfalls
and his paper moons, wrought in
the gorgeous background,—dire were
the denunciations hurled against
those who seemed bent on transforming
the theatre into a prodigious
panoramic peep-show, to which the
dialogue of the players has about the
same merely accessory relation as
the music of the orchestra. And
these last are the most frequent
cries, now that Mr Charles Kean
has so far outstript his predecessors
as almost to create an epoch in the
history of the stage, by the production
of spectacles which, for splendour
and truth of representation,
could, some years ago, have hardly
been deemed possible. On the production
of <cite>Sardanapalus</cite>, it was said
that he had turned his theatre into
a Gallery of Illustration, and that,
properly read, his playbills invited
the public to witness, not the Drama
of <cite>Sardanapalus</cite>, but the Diorama
of Nineveh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, suppose that this, and worse
than all this, is true—granting that
the stage is in the worst state possible,
let us compare the denunciations
now directed against it with
the description that Gifford gives of
a period which we are accustomed
to look back upon us a kind of
golden age. It may be instructive
to quote the passage, as a warning
to those who may be disposed to
howl too lugubriously over the
fancied ruin of the drama. In the
preface to the <cite>Mæviad</cite>, published in
1795, he writes as follows: “I
know not if the stage has been so
low, since the days of Gammer
Gurton, as at this hour. It seems
as if all the blockheads in the kingdom
had started up, and exclaimed
with one voice, ‘Come, let us write
for the theatres.’ In this there is
nothing, perhaps, altogether new;
the striking and peculiar novelty of
the times seems to be, that <span class='fss'>ALL</span> they
write is received. Of the three parties
concerned in this business, the
writers and the managers seem the
least culpable. If the town will
feed on husks, extraordinary pains
need not be taken to find them anything
more palatable. But what
shall we say of the people? The
lower orders are so brutified by the
lamentable follies of O’Keefe, and
Cobbe, and Pilon, and I know not
who—<i><span lang="la">Sardi venales</span></i>, each worse than
the other—that they have lost all
relish for simplicity and genuine
humour; nay, ignorance itself, unless
it be gross and glaring, cannot hope
for ‘their most sweet voices.’ And
the higher ranks are so mawkishly
mild that they take with a placid
simper whatever comes before them;
or, if they now and then experience
a slight fit of disgust, have not resolution
enough to express it, but sit
yawning and gaping in each other’s
faces for a little encouragement in
their culpable forbearance.” Then,
in a note to the <cite>Baviad</cite>, he speaks
of a deep even lower than the bathos
of O’Keefe. On referring to Morton,
Reynolds, and Holcroft—to “Morton’s
catchword,” to Reynolds’ “flippant
trash,” and to “Holcroft’s Shug-lane
cant”—he asks, “Will future
ages believe that this facetious triumvirate
should think nothing
more to be necessary to the construction
of a play than an eternal
repetition of some contemptible vulgarity,
such as ‘That’s your sort!’
‘Hey, damme!’ ‘What’s to pay!’
‘Keep moving!’ &#38;c. They will:
for they will have blockheads of <em>their
own</em>, who will found their claims to
celebrity on similar follies. What,
however, they will never credit is,
that these drivellings of idiotism,
these catchwords, should actually
preserve their respective authors
from being hooted off the stage.
No, they will not believe that an
English audience could be so besotted,
so brutified, as to receive
such senseless exclamations with
bursts of laughter, with peals of
applause. I cannot believe it myself,
though I have witnessed it.
<i><span lang="la">Haud credo</span></i>—if I may reverse the
good father’s position—<i><span lang="la">haud credo,
quia possibile est.</span></i>” And not to quote
further, let us but cite his description
of the tragedy of the time:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“From first to last</div>
      <div class='line'>Your joy is fustian, and your grief bombast;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rhetoric has banished reason; kings and queens</div>
      <div class='line'>Vent in hyperboles their royal spleens;</div>
      <div class='line'>Guardsmen in metaphors express their hopes;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ‘maidens, in white linen,’ howl in tropes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Terribly severe is all this—terrible
for its truth. Gifford was not the
man to write mincingly. Nor ought
we, at the present day, to write
mincingly of the iniquities and stupidities
of the stage. But the fact
is, that whatever be the shortcomings
of the British stage at the present
moment, and however much it
may deserve the denunciations of
criticism, it is incumbent on us to
dwell on those indications of promise
which are too much overlooked,
rather than on the enormous deficiencies
which are patent to every
observer. Let us see whether the
illustrative tendency of the time may
not have its bright side as well as a
dark, and may not have a higher
purpose than spectacular effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would indeed be a great mistake
to imagine, that in the production
of <cite>King Henry VIII.</cite>, and the
other dramas that went before it, the
principal object of Mr Charles Kean
was simply to place upon the stage
a dazzling spectacle, and that his
success as a manager has been due to
a correct appreciation of the public
taste in this matter. Were this the
case, there would be nothing special
in his managerial career. Brilliant
spectacle is nothing new in the history
of the theatre—and the history
of the English theatre. In the days
of James I., some of the stage properties
were so very splendid, that
we have read of certain lieges who
were afraid lest the double-gilt magnificence
of the tragedy-kings should
cast the majesty of the real sovereign
into shade, and so endanger
the crown. However absurd and
chimerical, what could be more gorgeous
than the masques and pageants
which were so common in those
days? Our extravaganzas (counterparts,
to a certain extent, of the ancient
masque), although they are
more appropriate in costume, and
altogether more matter of fact, are
not nearly so garish. Where, nowadays,
shall we find a queen willing
to act like Queen Anne of Denmark—she
and the ladies of her court
acting the negresses in Ben Jonson’s
masque of <cite>Blackness</cite>? Such magnificence
Mr Charles Kean assuredly
cannot rival, and his claim to originality
is not founded on the gorgeousness
of the spectacle which he
has placed before the footlights:
he claims the praise of historical
accuracy. It will be remembered
how, in the playbill of his <cite>Macbeth</cite>—a
curiosity in its way—he cited
the authority of Diodorus Siculus,
Pliny, Strabo, Xiphilin, Snorre, Ducange,
and the Eyrbiggia Saga—(not
bad for a playbill, the Eyrbiggia
Saga!)—and in the not less remarkable
programme of <cite>Sardanapalus</cite>,
he lays so great a stress on the
virtues of antiquarian research and
historical fidelity, as not only to
speak of his having learnt that scenic
illustration, <em>if it have the weight of
authority</em>, may adorn and add dignity
to the noble works of genius;
and to assert that in decoration of
every kind, whether scenic or otherwise,
he has, in the first instance, aimed
at truth, with the grand object of
conveying to the stage an accurate
portraiture and a living picture of a
bygone age; but also to point it out
as a note-worthy fact that, until the
present moment, it has been impossible
to render Lord Byron’s tragedy
of <cite>Sardanapalus</cite> upon the stage
with proper dramatic effect, <em>because
until now we have known nothing of
Assyrian architecture and costume</em>;
so that, according to this view, it is
not enough to have for such plays an
architecture and costume artistically
correct—they must also be historically
genuine. This magnifying of
historical truth, this drifting from
the open and trackless sea of fiction
to the <em>terra firma</em> and unalterable
landmarks of fact—a strong tendency
to <span class='fss'>REALISM</span>, is the chief characteristic
of Mr Kean’s management. And
it is observable not merely in his
mode of placing a drama upon the
stage, but in his own style of acting.
Look at Louis XI.—look at Cardinal
Wolsey, remarkable for the specification
of little traits and details that
serve to realise the character as
much as possible in that style which
has been called pre-Raphaelite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor is this tendency peculiar to
the management of the Princess’s
Theatre. It is manifested in various
ways on nearly every stage throughout
the country, sometimes absurdly
enough. A provincial theatre
announces a grand chivalric spectacle,
“with seven hundred pounds’ worth
of real armour!” A New York
theatre announces that the <cite>School
for Scandal</cite> will be produced with
magnificent carpets, mirrors, and
genuine silver plate! <cite>Whittington
and his Cat</cite> is produced with a <em>real</em>
rat amongst the crowds of sham
ones, only the sense of reality is
destroyed by the terrier that plays
the cat, forgetting his catskin and
beginning to yelp. One of the City
theatres, in announcing the <cite>Hertfordshire
Tragedy</cite>, set forth that the
very gig in which Thurtell drove his
victim to be murdered, and the
very table on which the pork-chops
were afterwards devoured, would
form part of the stage properties—being
expressly engaged for this
theatre. In contrast with such inane
realism, one had considerable satisfaction
in gazing on the dog which
Launcelot Gobbo, in Mr Talfourd’s
travesty of <cite>Shylock</cite>, so triumphantly
led about—a toy-spaniel on wheels.
It is perhaps unfair to quote in such
a connection the latest vagary of
this realistic tendency—a curious bit
of pre-Raphaelitism—on the part of
Messrs Tom Taylor and Charles
Reade, who, intending in the <cite>King’s
Rival</cite> to produce as complete a picture
as possible of the times of Charles
II.—with its wit and wantonness,
courtesies, familiarities, periwigs, Mr
Pepys, and Spring Gardens—actually
brought Major Wildman on the stage,
in shirt and breeches, wet and torn,
and abominably plague-stricken, all
the people flying from the unsightly
wretch as from an Afrit of the horrible
Kaf, or a Goul of the bottomless
pit. And so, for the sake of presenting
a picture of perfect accuracy,
these authors chose to turn the
theatre into a Chamber of Horrors.
And since this pre-Raphaelitism, or
an antiquarianism worse than pre-Raphaelitism,
is the order of the
day, we are sometimes surprised that
none of the managers has seized
upon that one of Shakespeare’s plays
in which, of all others, there is room
for the display of historical ingenuity,
and all the originality of research.
We allude to the <cite>Tempest</cite>,
and hope they will make use of
the idea, when we point out that as,
according to Mr Kean, it was impossible
to represent the <cite>Sardanapalus</cite>
of Lord Byron upon the stage until
Mr Layard made his discoveries at
Nineveh; so, until about fifty years
ago, when Mr Malone’s <cite>Essay on the
Tempest</cite> was published, it was impossible
to produce that play adequately
in any theatre. The Rev. Joseph
Hunter has attempted to identify the
abode of Prospero with Lampedusa,
an island half-way between Malta
and the African coast, grounding
his opinion upon this amongst other
facts, that Lampedusa furnishes the
Maltese with firewood, and Prospero
sends Caliban forth to collect firewood!
This, however, is but child’s-play
to the labour of Malone, who not
only succeeds in identifying the island
with the Bermudas, but actually discovers
the identical tempest that gives
its name to the play—“the dreadful
hurricane that dispersed the fleet of
Sir George Somers and Sir Thomas
Gates, in July 1609, on their passage
with a large supply of provisions and
men for the infant colony in Virginia,
by which the Admiral ship, as it was
called, having those commanders on
board [‘some noble creatures’], was
separated from the rest of the fleet,
and wrecked on the Island of Bermuda.”
Then come the incidental
phrases descriptive of the storm that
identify it with the <cite>Tempest</cite>—“Admiral
ship parted from the rest of the
fleet”—“they resolved to shut up the
hatches”—“take leave of each other”—“ship
struck upon a rock”—“most
luckily thrown up between two, as
upright as if she had been on the
stocks”—“arrived in safety without
the loss of a man”—“Bermodes”—“Isle
of Devils”—“enchanted place”—“sea-monster
in shape like a man”—“richest,
pleasantest, most healthful
place ever seen.” What a splendid
hit Mr Kean or Mr Phelps would
make if only some possible Mr Layard
could be found who should go and
excavate the cell of Prospero! Why
not? Is there not perfect truth in
what Mr Charles Mathews says:—“In
France the dramatic authors
have free permission to distort history
ingeniously, on condition of being gay
and witty. In England, provided we
are true to history, we have free permission
to be dull and tiresome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, if some of the phrases which
we have been using, have been used
correctly; if we have been right in
speaking of the pre-Raphaelitism and
realism of the theatre, it will be evident
that the question as to the present
state of the drama, in particular,
resolves itself into a much wider
question as to the present state of art
generally. And the fact is, that the
more narrowly we examine the sister
arts, the more nearly do we find that
they assimilate. In the pictorial art
we find the same symptoms of disintegration
and decay as in the dramatic;
in both, we find the same
elements of promise. Look at the
walls of our exhibition-rooms, and
behold the inanities that figure there,
contemporary with the inanities of
the theatre. This picture either displays
as little action as a modern tragedy,
or its action is as spasmodic as
an Adelphi melodrama. In how many
of these pictures do we find the artists
compensating for bad drawing with
gaudy colour, hiding vacancy of expression
in a blaze of light, feebleness
of passion in a tornado of shadows,
and blundering perspective, aerial and
linear, in a mist as convenient as the
clouds by which the gods of Homer
saved their heroes from the lances of
the enemy? The very faults we find
in the theatre! Eternal mannerism,
staginess, mimicry, trickery, grimacing,
catchwords, red lights and blue
lights, and the name of the perruquier
mentioned in the playbills in large
letters! In how many pictures of
naked legs in the last Exhibition,
did you not recognise the calves of
the gallant grenadier who is now
fighting the battles of his country?
That beard, that turban; we think
we have seen the face of that Turkish
Jew in at least fifty-seven pictures;
and he so haunts us throughout the
Exhibition-rooms in a thousand intolerable
disguises—his long nose here,
and his cold brown eye there, as if, after
using him whole as long as possible,
the artists at length cut him into
little pieces, and made a division of
his remains, that really it would be a
pleasure to know that such had been
his actual fate. It is the very vice of
the stage, where we find Mr A—— (who
plays the villains), or Mr B—— (who
plays the enamoured young
gentleman), or Mr C—— (who does
the comic), eternally playing themselves,
and through every possible
transformation presenting us with the
same legs and arms, and expressive
nose and cracked voice. Whether on
the boards or on the canvass, incapacity
and commonplace issue in virtually
the same results. And it so happens
that if one were asked what are
the most striking, the most note-worthy,
or the most notorious peculiarities,
at this moment, of our picture-galleries
on the one hand, or of the
theatres on the other, one must inevitably
fix upon the pre-Raphaelitism
of the one, and the Revivalism of the
other, and recognise them as twins.
Only it must be remembered that the
pre-Raphaelitism of the picture-galleries
is but one of the forms, although
the most peculiar form, in
which the tendency to realism is
manifested. It is manifested not less
determinately in the prominence
given to portraiture—portraits of
“men, women, and Herveys,” portraits
of dogs, portraits of horses,
portraits of prize oxen and pigs, and
dead game, and black-faced ewes.
The colouring which Gibson gives to
his statues is a move in the same direction.
And the tendency is symbolised
and strengthened by the photographic
art which has sprung up
within the last few years, and promises,
whether for good or for evil,
to exercise so much influence on
every easel throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>To come to the point then: What
is the meaning of all this realism?
If, with all the multiform absurdities
in which it is manifested, it must
nevertheless be admitted that all or
most of the symptoms of vitality in
the imitative arts are at the present
moment expressed in this manner,
what is the value of it?</p>

<p class='c009'>The fact is, that whenever this tendency
to realism is manifested with
more than ordinary force (we were
going to say, virulence), it is a most
critical symptom. It is distinctive
of what the old physicians would have
called two separate climacterics in
the history of art. It marks the infancy
and the old age of art—the
rise and the fall. It is just as in the
individual man—at first in childhood,
and at last in second childhood,
he worships the real, and refuses
to accept what he cannot believe
in as absolutely and historically
true. “But is it true?” inquires the
child; “is it a fact?” says the old
man. The precise difference between
the realism of infancy and that of
age is another matter to which we
shall afterwards have to refer: at
present we have only to do with
their generic identity. And as the
individual man is in almost every respect
a miniature of the race, so we
find this generic realism characteristic
of at once the beginning and the
end of art. In the middle space it
culminates towards the pure azure of
the ideal.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not sure, however, that this
doctrine as to the periods of realism,
evident as it would seem to be, will
obtain the immediate acceptance of
every reader: we are not sure, because
the counter-view has more than
once already been put forward—and
by some of the critics in the present
century has been maintained
with great vigour, that art displays
most imagination in its infancy, and
that—as at once a proof and illustration
of the fact—we find its most ancient
works to be the best. While
the doctrine, as commonly advanced,
seems to make this wide and sweeping
generalisation, it is of course more
cautiously worded, so as to apply
chiefly to poetry—epical and lyrical:
as applied to the dramatic or imitative
arts, there is such a mass of evidence
against it, that it could safely
be advanced only by implication. But
it is not true even with reference to
the narrative poet—call him what
men will—bard, aoidos, minstrel,
maker, minnesinger, scald. For observe,
that the point in dispute is not
whether the most ancient poets are the
best; grant for a moment that they
are: but wherein lies their distinguishing
excellence? are they more
<em>imaginative</em> than later ones? Nothing
of the kind: the <em>imaginative</em> poets
belong to what a geologist would call
the pleiocene formation—a much later
epoch. The elder bards are remarkable
above all things for their truthfulness,
their minute observation,
their naturalness, their reality. Life,
the present life in the present world,
was to them an overwhelming reality,
and they had no inclination, little
need, to imagine a new world, and go
and live in it. A most wonderful imagination
they certainly displayed,
but they were quite unconscious of
the gift: they did not imagine, like
Edmund Spenser or John Keats, for
the sake of imagining; they did not
dream for the mere pleasure of dreaming.
Their pleasure in dreaming was
a sub-conscious pleasure. Truth was
the grand and ostensible object; and
if the facts which they proposed to
discover and describe were often mere
fancies, still they were not recognised
as fancies. A mere imagination they
would have regarded as a mere lie.
The so-called facts for which, in modern
phrase, they were indebted to
imagination, they professed to have
received from reason, from memory,
from inspiration, from veritable supernatural
vision, always from a credible
source. And here, indeed, lies
the strength of the argument which
refers the origin of verse to the requirements
of memory, so that versification
was in its first intention but
a system of mnemonics. Right or
wrong, that theory has been endorsed
by illustrious names; and it must be
admitted even by an opponent, that
the whole tone of the elder poetry
speaks in its favour. There is a tone
of sincerity in the elder poets, as if
they could not play with their subject,
and as if upon them all had been bestowed
the gift which a fairy is said
to have bestowed upon Thomas of
Ercildoune—the tongue that could
not lie, the tongue that could not
feign. They never seem to be telling
tales; they are relating histories.
They do not attempt to tickle
the imagination; they are committing
important and interesting facts
to memory. And this also is the reason
why the rhyming chroniclers—say
Robert de Brunne, or Robert of
Gloucester, who were nothing but
rhymers—were nevertheless regarded
as true poets. They narrated history
in numerous verse: what more did
those who were truly called poets
profess to do? These latter made
their narratives more interesting, but
it was not recognised that the narratives
were of a different kind. Psychological
analysis had not yet penetrated
so far as to discern imagination
in the true poet, and none in the
rhyming chronicler. It had not yet
discovered that the office of the poet
is more than this—viz., to tell what
he knows faithfully, pleasingly, and
in verse. Credibility was deemed the
first virtue of the poet, the primrose
of the poetical flora. What if their
world be all or half unreal?—still
they believed it to be real. As it is
long before the poor mortals who
have been snatched away to Elfland
discover that all the splendour which
surrounds them is but a dream, that
the gold is dross, and the diamonds
glass, and the brocades worsted, and
the velvets cotton, and all unreality;
even so the poets of a country (children
kidnapped from a better world)
do not all at once discover that the
world they live in is wholly unreal,
wholly ideal. They are, at first, the
most extreme of realists.</p>

<p class='c009'>It thus appears that even in poetry
the early period is remarkable for its
realism. The poets do not begin with
sublimated fancies in the highest
heaven of invention. The ascent of
Mont Blanc is quite a modern feat.
All that old Provençal minstrelsy—sirvente
and chanson—murmurs at
the foot of the Alps. And if this be
true of poetry, it is much more true
of the imitative arts—the drama,
painting, and sculpture. If sculpture
perished in the realism of Roman
portraiture, it began with the realism
of Egyptian mummy—inglorious
attempt to preserve the real thing.
The same law holds in painting. In
his work on the North American
Indians, Mr Catlin describes a little
incident which furnishes a very good
illustration of how a savage regards
painting, and how the art in its infancy
would infallibly be treated. In
taking the likeness of one of these
Indians, Mr Catlin proceeded to paint
the shadow of the nose, to the no small
bewilderment of the onlookers, who
immediately found fault with the
dark patch. He pointed out the
shadow of the nose which it was intended
to represent; but no—they
were unable to understand; it was
an injury to the countenance of their
medicine-man; there must be no
shadow, and without shadow the
picture was painted. They insisted
on his painting reality, not appearance.
We find the counterpart of
this in the old medieval pictures—all
so shadowless. The feeling for
shadow stole very gradually over the
artistic mind. And in many other
details one might note how the
painter, in the early dawn of the art,
seeks to represent the object before
him, not as it appears to his eye at
one particular moment, but as it is,
or as he knows it to be, in reality.
He knows, for example, that a hand
is the flattened extremity of the arm,
ending in five points; in his pictures,
accordingly, the hand is invariably
spread out with the unmistakable
digits—one, two, three, four, five—always
five. And we do not
know that there is anything in
the history of art more remarkable
than the contrast between our present
mode of regarding a picture,
and that which we find current in
the olden times. We regard a picture
as a picture—a representation—a
memory—an imagination. Three
hundred years ago, it was the established
formula of praise to say that
it was a reality—the thing itself.
One might still go farther back and
recall the anecdotes told of the old
Greek painters—of the horse neighing
to the picture of a horse by
Apelles, and the curious test which
Zeuxis applied to one of his pictures,
the birds coming to eat the grapes,
which were thus shown to be well
painted, but unterrified by the figure
of the man who carried the grapes,
which was thus shown to be badly
painted.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> And we might quote whole
pages from Vasari to show how an
artist and a critic of the <i><span lang="it">cinque cento</span></i>
looked upon a work of art. We will
quote but one or two sentences:
“Every touch of the pencil,” says
Vasari of one of Raphael’s Madonnas—“every
touch of the pencil in
the heads, hands, and feet of this
work, has produced such effect that
the parts seem rather to be of the
living flesh than the mere colours of
the painter.” Again, with reference
to musical instruments in a picture
of St Cecilia, he says, that they “lie
scattered around her; and these do
not seem to be merely painted, but
might be taken for the real objects
represented.” Yet again he says,
“It may indeed with truth be declared
that the paintings of other
masters are properly to be called
paintings, but those of Raphael may
well be designated the life itself, for
the flesh trembles, the breathing is
made obvious to sight, the pulses in
his figures are beating, and life is in
its utmost animation through all his
works.” Here we find still in force
the old feeling after realism which is
characteristic of the earliest period
of art, and we find it coincident with
a style of painting that more and
more daily tended towards conventional
treatment and idealisations—until
at length, in course of time,
ideality, having reached its highest
point, passed into allegory, and in
these allegories too often took the
one venturesome step from the sublime
to the ridiculous, so that we
can scarcely regard Goldsmith as indulging
in caricature when he described
the painting of the Wakefield
family, with Mrs Primrose as Venus,
and the worthy doctor in a gown and
bands presenting her with his books
on the Whistonian controversy;
Olivia, an amazon, dressed in a green
Joseph; Sophia, a shepherdess, with
plenty of sheep; and poor Moses with
a hat and white feather. Let any
one who doubts this turn to Rubens’
allegories descriptive of the life and
reign of Marie de Medici, where
naked young gentlemen appear at
court beside ladies overladen with
dress, where the caduceus fraternises
with the crosier, and the queen grasps
indifferently a thyrsus or a sceptre;
where Mercury stands unabashed by
the legate of the pope, his winged
hat in delightful contrast with the
red hat of the cardinal; and where
one can hardly tell which is more
terrible, the lion raging on earth, or
the lion gloriously rampant amongst
the signs of the Zodiac. And if now,
against such bewildering allegory and
algebraic generalisations, the caricature
of ideality, we find the present
generation of artists protesting with
perhaps too much vehemence, and
all more or less in one way or another—sometimes
soberly, sometimes extravagantly—returning
again to realism,
what are we to say? Is it the
art of painting sinking into dotage,
or the art of painting renewing its
youth? Certainly, whatever faults
have been attributed to the realists
of our time, we are not aware that
they have ever been charged with
the sin of paralytic senility.</p>

<p class='c009'>The charge of senility might be
brought with far more appropriateness
against the drama in its present
state, although, even as applied to the
drama, one cannot choose but indulge
the belief that it is too severe.
If we detect at one and the same
time a tendency to excessive realism
in the drama, and in the pictorial and
plastic arts, it is difficult to believe
that what, with all its extravagance,
is symptomatic of youth and progress
in the one, should be symptomatic
only of decrepitude and ruin
in the other. These arts are so nearly
allied that one might almost say they
rise and fall together. At all events,
their history is the same, and runs
the same cycles. We have spoken
of the realism out of which painting
and sculpture spring. Like painting
and sculpture, the drama springs out
of realism the most extreme: it
springs out of lyricism. The lyric,
strictly speaking, and in its fundamental
idea, is an expression of the
real feelings of the singer himself:
he is not a lyrist, but a dramatist,
who gives expression to the supposed
feelings of other people. The true
lyrist sings because he cannot help
singing—a dirge because he is sad, an
elegy because he mourns the loss of
a friend, pœans because he is joyful,
sapphics because he is in love, anacreontics
because he has tasted the
pleasures of wine. And so with
every lyrical art; it is the irrepressible
ebullition of a genuine feeling.
Take dancing, for example. The
ballet, as every one understands, is
not natural dancing; the ballet-dancers
are not true children of
Terpsichore (she is their step-mother,
if you like). Every one understands
that in its central idea dancing
is the expression of a real, not an
assumed feeling on the part of the
dancer: he dances for joy—he dances
because the music excites him to
motion. Music is, in fact, the redeeming
principle of dancing on the
stage and for show: without music
it would be meaningless. The orchestra
furnishes to the apprehension
of every spectator a sufficient reason
for the evolutions of the dancer, so
that the dancing is but the visible
incarnation of the melody. And
music in this way preserves, to a
certain extent, the lyrical character
of the ballet, all the gyrations and
saltations of which appear to be the
natural consequences of a <em>genuine</em>
feeling, which has been created by
the music, and which the spectators
have in common with the <i><span lang="fr">corps de
ballet</span></i>, and therefore know to be real.
Thus, even when it mounts the stage,
the lyrical art must authenticate itself;
even in assuming a dramatic
form, the lyric must attempt to establish
its own veracity in the highest
and strictest sense—its own reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it is out of such realism that
the drama by every natural process
arises. And we are not theorising
when we say this. It is a well-known
fact, that the Greek drama—the
tragedy not less than the comedy—sprung
out of the Dionysiac festivals,
and the drunken dithyrambic revelry
of its songs and dances; and there
is no theory in the world that can
half so well illustrate the relation of
the lyric proper to the drama proper,
as the history of the rise of the histrionic
art in Greece. There the
ancient worshippers sang their choral
odes to the great Dionysus—Dionysus,
not merely the god of wine, but
the very vital principle of nature.
They hymned his praises with extraordinary
fervour—with such enthusiasm,
in fact, that they passed beyond
the merely lyrical expression of
admiration and devotion into the
dramatic imitation of his traditional
exploits. As the god of Nature, he
was the god of endless transformations,
and these enthusiastic revellers
not only sang the glories and the
eclipses of the changing year, but in
the height of the inflamed zeal
which carried them away, enacted
in their own persons, and according
to certain typical traditions of Satyrs
and Fauns, Dryads and Hamadryads,
the stupendous mysteries of physical
mutation. They assumed the goatlike
appearance of Satyrs; they dashed
about like woodland nymphs;
Pan became innumerable; Silenus
appeared in a thousand reflections.
It is utterly prosaic to speak of these
hirsute appendages, multitudinous
horns, leaves covering the face, the
manifold strange disguises assumed by
the populace, as if they were the mere
masks and dominoes of a modern revel.
They were much more than masks and
dominoes. They were the poetical
costume of the characters with which,
in all the heat and flush of wine, the
worshippers identified themselves. It
was an extravagant fanaticism by
which, in celebrating the joys and
the sorrows of Dionysus, they passed
out of themselves, ceased to sing of
the god as far away, and of his history
as belonging to the olden time,
and suddenly became there and then
that which they celebrated;—an extravagance
to which a parallel may
be found even in some of the phases
of the Christian religion, as amongst
not a few of the extremer Protestant
fanatics, and notably in Catholic
countries amongst the mystics—the
Estatica, rising beyond the lyrical
mood of adoration and enraptured
gazing, suddenly stretching forth her
arms and limbs until they become
cruciform, and so standing entranced
and dramatised, until actually, by a
peculiarly subtle sympathy, which
the physiologists regard as not inexplicable,
the stigmata may be traced
on the hands and feet. And so it
ever happens that the dramatic is
evolved out of the lyrical—the assumed
out of the real—the representative
impersonation out of the genuine sentiment.
It is an historic fact that the
drama, with its myriad personalities,
is generated from the lyric, as the colours
of the prism form a ray of pure
light; and that, as for example in the
Greek Æschylus, and the English
Marlowe, it is in its earliest development
imbued with lyricism. In other
words, it is at first essentially Realistic.</p>

<p class='c009'>But here arises a question to which
we have already referred. If the
imitative arts begin with realisation,
and end in realisation, what is the
difference between the beginning and
the end? What is the difference between
the child looking up in your
face, and saying, “But is it true?” and
the old man asking, “Is it a fact?”
We must beg pardon if we attempt
to answer that question by help of a
little psychology.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Scottish philosophers talk a
great deal about the fundamental beliefs
of the human mind, one of the
most important of these being our
belief in the uniformity of nature.
Granted—that we have a general
belief in the constancy of nature, and
in this faith expect that the future
shall be as the past. But with the
usual meagreness of the elder Scottish
psychologists, and with an absence
of scientific precision that is
also too frequent, they stated the law
very loosely: they stated the law,
not as we find it aboriginal in the
human mind, but as we find it corrected
by experience. In its aboriginal
form, the belief may be stated
thus: whatever is, must be, and could
not have been otherwise—whatever
happens, happens of necessity. A
child accepts every event in this
simple faith, and it is often exceedingly
difficult to convince the little
soul that what has happened once,
may not and will not happen again.
Experience comes with years, and
corrects the stringency of the law;
the idea of accident enters, and while
a general belief in the constancy of
nature still remains, it no longer
usurps the throne of absolute law.
Perhaps the process goes even further,
until at length, in the mind’s dotage,
certainty is banished from our expectations,
the muse of history becomes
the most incredible of Cassandras,
and the whole world lies
dead before us and around us, with
men and women rattling over it
like dice from a dice-box. And here
we detect precisely the difference
between the realism of childhood and
poetry, and the realism of dotage and
prose. The child in everything perceives
the element of necessity; the
old man perceives only the element
of contingency. In particulars, the
child perceives the universal; the
old man perceives in particulars only
the particular. This makes all the
difference between prose and poetry.
In the intermediate space between
infancy and dotage, dissatisfied with
the real, we create an ideal world,
where all is necessary and universal.
There is nothing true in history,
says Horace Walpole, save the names
and the dates; and so we pass into
fiction, where the names and the
dates are the only things that are not
true. But at the two poles the ideal
is forgotten. At the one—namely, in
the youth of men or of nations—the
real supplies its place, being viewed
in that generality, necessity, eternity—call
it what you will—which is the
condition of the ideal. At the other—namely,
in the decline of individuals
or of nations—the real is all in all;
and it is nothing but the real, just as
in the case of Peter Bell,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A primrose by the river’s brim,</div>
      <div class='line'>A yellow primrose was to him,</div>
      <div class='line'>And it was nothing more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It will be observed that, in contrasting
the two poles of realism, we have
not made any allusion to the absence
or the presence of imagination; and
this because the word is so liable to
misconception. But if we are correct
in distinguishing the realism of youth
from the realism of senility, by saying
that in the one case every circumstance
is recognised as a necessity,
every detail is viewed as eternally
and universally true, while in the
other all is more or less regarded as
chance-work, which might or might
not have been—what is this but saying,
that in the one case facts appeal
to the imagination, in the other
merely to sense? It is the imagination
that magnifies insular facts into
continental truths, and immortalises
momentary feelings by raising them
into eternal laws. The Imagination
is, <em>par excellence</em>, the faculty of generalisation—a
fact which the psychologists
commonly overlook. It indeed
always regards the concrete, always
regards the individual; and that is
the great fact which the psychologists
are accustomed to dwell upon, while
at the same time they overlook the
principal characteristic of imagination,
which is this, that it never regards
the individual merely as an
individual, nor the concrete merely
as a concrete; it regards the individual
as representative of a species,
and the concrete as a type of something
more general. The imagination
is to our other faculties what Cuvier
or Owen is to other men. Give to
Professor Owen a single bone—even
the single bone of an extinct animal,
and he will determine the size and
position of every other bone, and the
entire structure of the bird or beast.
Give to the imagination a single fact,
and it has the same marvellous significance,
and myriads of other facts
link on to it by the most inevitable
obligation. And it is because in this
temper the youthful mind seizes upon
facts, that even when it clings to
them far more tenaciously, and dwells
upon them far more minutely than
superannuated minds do, its realism
has a worth and a hopefulness to
which any other kind of realism can
make no pretensions. The realism
of dotage is gossip—merest gossip.
The lace in a Dutch portrait—every
thread and loop painted, what is it
but old wives’ gossip? Compare this
uninteresting imitation of point lace,
velvets, and silks and satins, with
the young Titian painting in the eye
of one of his figures the reflection of
a window. This is the realism of a
boy, that is the realism of old women.</p>

<p class='c009'>The drift of our argument will now
be apparent. We have shown that
the distinguishing feature of the
modern drama is its tendency to
Realism, and that it exhibits this
tendency at present in common with
the other imitative arts. We have
also shown that the tendency to realism
is characteristic of art in two
periods of its history—namely, its
rise and its decline; and we have
endeavoured to explain the difference
between the realism that characterises
the rise of art, and the realism
that marks its decadence. Then
here arises the question of questions:
To which period does the realism
that signalises at present the imitative
arts in general, and the dramatic
art in particular, belong? Is it the
realism of progress, or the realism of
decay? It is the most difficult question
of all; at least, it is the question
to which it is most difficult in our
present circumstances to give a very
decided answer. Having stated the
law and summed up the evidence, we
should certainly be glad to shift to a
jury the responsibility of pronouncing
an absolute verdict as to the question
of fact. The difficulty of pronouncing
such a verdict is easily accounted
for. In a period which is one of revival
and not of imitation, it is most
natural that we should find the two
kinds of realism more or less blending
together—the literalness of an
exhausted epoch, and the faithfulness
of a regenerated life. And amid all
the pre-Raphaelitism of the stage and
of the picture-galleries, it is nothing
wonderful that we should find much
to condemn, much of that literalness
which is unworthy and imbecile.
When, to quote an extreme instance—when
Thurtell’s gig, with “some
of the real water from the pond,” is
exhibited on the boards of the Surrey
Theatre, it is such another exhibition
as we find in the degradation of the
Roman drama—a degradation, by the
way, which old Thomas Heywood
describes as amongst the highest
honours of the drama. There is so
much naïveté in his description that
we shall quote it:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Julius Cæsar himself, for his pleasure,
became an actor, being in shape,
state, voice, judgment, and all other occurrents,
exterior and interior, excellent.
Amongst many other parts acted by him
in person, it is recorded of him that, with
general applause in his own theatre, he
played Hercules Furens; and, amongst
many other arguments of his completeness,
excellence, and extraordinary care
in his action, it is thus reported of him:
Being in the depth of a passion, one of
his servants (as his part then fell out)
presenting Lychas, who before had from
Dejanira brought him the poisoned shirt,
dipt in the blood of the centaur Nessus,
he, in the middest of his torture and
fury, finding this Lychas hid in a remote
corner (appointed him to creep into of
purpose), although he was, as our tragedians
use, but seemingly to kill him by
some false imagined wound, yet was
Cæsar so carried away with the violence
of his practised fury, and by the perfect
shape of the madness of Hercules to
which he had fashioned all his active
spirits, that he slew him dead at his
foot, and after swung him, <i><span lang="la">terque quaterque</span></i>
(as the poet says) about his head.
It was the manner of their emperors in
those days, in their public tragedies, to
choose out the fittest amongst such as
for capital offences were condemned to
die, and employ them in such parts as
were to be killed in the tragedy, who of
themselves would make suit rather to die
with resolution, and by the hands of such
princely actors, than otherwise to suffer
a shameful and most detestable end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And this, which honest old Heywood
is willing to commend because
done by an emperor, is in fact, <i><span lang="la">parvis
componere magna</span></i>, the exact parallel
to the incident already mentioned—the
rat-killing in the pantomime of
<cite>Whittington and his Cat</cite>. It is
parallel also, in a certain degree, to
one of Mr Phelps’s early extravagances,
who, in his determination to
adhere to the text of Shakespeare,
actually ended <cite>Macbeth</cite> by the exhibition
of the traitor’s head—“Reenter
Macduff, with Macbeth’s head
on a pole.” One is inclined to believe
that had he not been himself
the Macbeth of the evening, he would
have made arrangements to exhibit
the veritable head of the actor who
performed the part.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while it is impossible to deny
the existence of such a baneful realism,
is this all? and does there not
predominate at the same time a far
more healthy tendency? Are not Mr
Charles Kean’s revivals of <cite>King John</cite>
and <cite>Macbeth</cite>—are not Mr Phelps’s
revivals, notwithstanding his early
vagary—of this kind? Is not, for
example, the historic fidelity with
which <cite>Macbeth</cite> is represented in the
Princess’s Theatre, something entirely
different in kind from that species of
realism which in the soliloquy,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Is this a dagger which I see before me,</div>
      <div class='line'>The handle towards my hand?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>actually exhibited a dagger hanging
in the air? There can be very little
doubt of it; and it may be said generally
that the realism displayed is
most frequently of the earnest and
healthy sort. If any misgiving should
arise with regard to this in the case
of the drama, one has a right to refer
to the realism manifested at the very
same time in the kindred art of painting,
and if not entirely to interpret
the one by the other, still to regard
the analogy as of great importance.
There are many of us who cannot admire
pre-Raphaelitism, with all its
extravagance and presumption, but
at all events we do not regard its
faults as the results of mental paralysis.
They are the faults of youth,
not of age—of the pleasant springtime
which the pre-Raphaelites love
to paint, when the leaves come forth in
all their delicacy, almost diaphonous
against the light, so that we trace
the tender veins and fibres in all their
minute windings—not of the yellowing
autumn, when again all nature
comes before us with excessive minuteness
of detail, but the detail of
faded leaves and the curious reticulation
of their skeletons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Right or wrong, it is at least more
pleasant to look thus hopefully on the
future of the drama than to fold one’s
hands, shrug one’s shoulders, and
give up all as lost. The drama! they
say—fiddlesticks! the drama has all
gone to the opera. Very well: and
why should not the drama go to the
opera? the music will do it no harm—on
the contrary, a great deal of good.
It is quite true that the opera, or, to
speak more generally, the musical
tendencies of the present time, act to
the hurt of the existing theatres; but
pity the man who ventures to dream
that the fortunes of the British drama
are to be identified with the fortunes
of the present theatres, as at present
conducted. On the contrary, it would
probably be no great misfortune to
the British drama, if, with one or
two exceptions, they were all burnt
to the ground; and however adverse
to the drama the present musical
taste may appear to be, it is not so
really, but full of promise, if the dramatists
would only see and use the
opportunity. What is the use of
running down illustration, dioramas,
and concerts? Would it not be better
for the dramatists to write up to
them? The British drama has at the
present moment two special haunts—the
theatre and the concert-hall.
It is needless for the dramatic authors
to complain that their pieces are
damned. Who cares for their pieces?
All they have to say has no relation
to our present habitudes and thoughts.
If they will write for the theatres, let
them write something worthy of illustration,
and be as realistic in their
writing as Mr Kean is in his acting,
and in his stage appointments. And
let them invade the concert-halls,
where a new drama is springing up
for the amusement of those who cannot
away with the theatre.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their position in the theatre at
present is not good, is not creditable
to them as a body, although we are
far from looking on it with despair,
and are far from saying that Othello’s
occupation is gone. It may be worth
our while to recognise clearly the
position which the drama has always
occupied in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shikspur? Shikspur? who wrote
it?” says Kitty, in <cite>High Life below
Stairs</cite>, when the worshipful Lady
Bab asks her if she had never read
Shikspur. There are perhaps not
many Mrs Kitties of the present day
who would give a similar answer.
But although the name of the great
dramatist has become a household
word amongst us, and his works are
perhaps better known than those of
any other writer in the language, he
is known rather as an author to be
read than as a dramatist whose plays
are to be witnessed. It is not to be
denied that upon the great majority
of the British people, and especially
of the middle classes, the theatre has
had little or no influence. It is utterly
ignored by them. From the
days of Elizabeth and James, when
the mayor and aldermen of London
did what they could to discountenance
the drama, and to oust Shakespeare
and Burbage from the Blackfriars’
Theatre, up to this present hour, the
playhouses, frequented by the aristocracy
of birth and the aristocracy of
education, and the players honoured
as “His Majesty’s Servants,” or,
“The Lord Chamberlain’s Company,”
have been regarded with suspicion
by the sober citizens of the middle
class. When the theatres rose into
importance, the Puritans rose into
importance, and the former have
never recovered from the denunciations
of the latter. These denunciations,
it is true, were often most intemperate,
and based on the most
ridiculous grounds (as when Gosson
denounced the acting of women’s
parts by boys as the sin which brought
the fiery judgment of heaven upon
Sodom and Gomorrah), yet when in
so many of the plays of the period,
and still more of the profligate reign
of the second Charles, we find profanity,
obscenity, and hardness of
heart presented as the most brilliant
of qualities, it is nothing wonderful
that the commonalty should have
been estranged. From the memory
of those impurities the theatre has
never entirely recovered, and there
are multitudes among us nowadays
who regard it as little better than a
lazaretto. It has indeed been very
much altered, so that in every respectable
theatre he must be nearly
as squeamish as those Americans
who are said by Sam Slick to have
put trousers on the legs of their pianofortes,
who is offended with what he
sees or hears: and yet still the old
repugnance remains; as if, like the
man who had the devil cast out of
him, the people regard it as a house
swept and garnished only to receive
seven other devils worse than before.
The fact is, that it is not enough to
introduce a negative morality into
the theatres: it is not enough that
the old devil should have been smoked
out, and the house swept and garnished,
if we find no positive substitute.
It is a genuine and noble substitute
that is wanted, not electroplate,
nor nickel silver. The most
offensive part of stage morality at
present is its hypocrisy. We should
infinitely prefer seeing the downright
licentiousness of Etherege and Sedley
to the sham sentiment and the canting
virtues that sometimes take the
place of it on the modern stage—we
mean especially in the afterpieces.
The former is an open
enemy, the other a disguised one.
And until we have true poetry in
the sentiment, and true chivalry in
the action, and that reverence which
is implied in poetry and chivalry, it
is not likely that the English people,
as a whole, will ever look to the
theatres. At present, the greater
number of dramatic writers seem to
expend their energies in the most
ephemeral manner. The burlesques
and pantomimes, we have said, are
about the best things produced on
the British stage. They are often
very amusing, and display a strange
prodigality of power—but power all
run to seed. The wit consists of
punning; the humour consists of
practical jokes, horrible grimace, and
elaborate buffoonery; the dialogue is
in the vernacular of the London
taverns and caves of harmony;<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> the
plot is not simply improbable, it is
impossible and incomprehensible;
the characters are little better than
marionettes, and their sentiments the
sentiments of puppets. Of course
there are exceptions, and brilliant
ones they are. Bulwer Lytton,
Sheridan Knowles, Douglas Jerrold,
Charles Reade, and a few others,
have shown what they can do in
a more serious vein. But, as a
whole, the dramatic literature of the
day is, as it has ever been since
the Restoration, more remarkable for
quantity than quality. Few persons
out of London, and not many even in
London, are well acquainted with
that literature, the extent of its surface,
the multiplicity of its currents,
its utter shallowness, and the incredible
mud that lies at the bottom of it;
and were we to attempt a very slight
analysis of its contents, run up a few
statistics, give one or two extracts,
and, in a word, describe it in its proper
colours, a tale would probably
be unfolded which would not only
somewhat astonish those who, living
in the provinces, seldom or never
enter a theatre, and are thus blessedly
ignorant of the carrion fare on
which metropolitan playgoers fatten
at half-price, but would also make
some of those who frequent the dramatic
temple not a little ashamed
that afterpieces which are unreadable
for their insipidity,<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> disgusting for
their bad taste, and still worse, contemptible,
although not so much for
their licentiousness as for the cant and
tremendous humbug of their hypocritical
moralities, should have power,
in the hands of a clever actor, to
charm the purer sensibilities of their
nature to sleep, so that, as if glamour
had been cast in their eyes,
trickery and tinsel pass for reality,
falsehood appears to be true, evil
good, and ugliness beautiful. In
such a state of things it is not likely
that the theatre should achieve a
popularity which it has never enjoyed;
and certainly its entire spirit
must be revolutionised ere it can
find a large welcome in the heart of
the nation. Read the modern novelists
and read the modern dramatists,
and observe the difference of tone.
There is in the common run of modern
dramas—whether tragedy,
comedy, or farce—such an utter
absence of noble purpose, that not a
whole army of claqueurs could ever
succeed in establishing their popularity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fact is, the Muse of the British
drama seems at this moment inclined
to vacate the theatres, and to take
up her abode in the halls and concert-rooms.
Like the old fairies of
the story-books, who, disgusted with
the treatment they receive in one
family, go and bestow their favours
on the household next door, the dramatic
Muse—a very old fairy indeed—is
tired of the position assigned to
her in the theatres. What is that?
On the ceiling, gracefully gyrating
round the gaselier, are the four
lightly-draped muses of the theatre,
with dagger, and mask, and harp,
and castanets in hand, while certain
naked amorini carry festoons of
flowers before them, and from every
jutty, frieze, and coign of vantage
on the cornice, horned satyrs and
ivy-crowned bacchantes leer out with
astonishment. The Muse of the
British drama is tired of dancing
over the gaselier, dancing over our
heads, and wishes to come down to
our hearts, and so she enters the
music-halls and concert-rooms, where
she patronises two distinct classes of
entertainments, the one more strictly
lyrical, the other more strictly dramatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to the more musical
kind of entertainment, it must have
been observed, that while songs and
ballads, and instrumentation have a
large sphere assigned to them, the
operatic airs are day by day assuming
more and more importance. It is
quite true that a cavatina sung in a
concert-room is very different from
the same cavatina sung on the stage.
The singing in a concert-room is like
the singing of statues—so expressionless.
We would rather not look at a
concert-singer—one who is merely a
concert-singer. Goethe makes the
same remark with respect to singers
generally. They remind one of the
ludicrous story which the monks report
of St Benedict,—that he was
heard singing psalms two or three
weeks before he was born, and saw
the light of day. You hear these
singers singing long before their faces
are born, long before they attain the
life of expression. Exceptions of
course there are occasionally, and
chiefly when a duet, a trio, or a quartette
is to be sung. And it requires
only an operatic singer, whose reputation
as prima donna or primo
tenore will excuse such a liberty, to
throw a truly dramatic expression
into the solos, for the practice to become
general. Why should not some
attempt be made by those who can, to
escape from the starched formality of
the concert-room—to forget that they
are in dress boots and white gloves—and
to impart somewhat of the animation
of the theatre into the pieces
of music which they hold so affectionately
in their hands, because it saves
their hands from even the inclination
to gesticulate? And with glee and
madrigal unions in every town, why
do not the dramatists see their opportunity,
and infuse somewhat more of
the dramatic element into those part
songs, out of which in time a little
drama might arise? Everything has
its insignificant beginnings, and, discreetly
managed, the incoherence of
our concerts might gradually be developed
into the organic unity of the
drama. It is coming to this, in fact.
The music-halls are becoming theatres
under a new and unobjectionable
name.</p>

<p class='c009'>With regard to the more dramatic
entertainments that are so popular in
those public halls, the new life is still
more apparent. We do not simply
refer to dramatic readings, although
these too have a vast influence—an
influence as superior to that of the
Elgin marbles in the British Museum,
to which we once heard the plays of
Shakespeare irreverently compared,
as the spell of the Ladye of Branksome,
who could raise the spirits to her
bidding, was to the power of William
of Deloraine, who lifted the massy
tombstone, and fetched the mystic
book from the coffin of the departed
wizard; an influence, too, as superior
to that of the rhapsodists who travelled
through the cities of Greece
reciting the lays of Homer (for they
recited these lays in detached fragments),
as the palace of Aladdin,
built in a night, is superior to the
single brick that Scholasticos carried
about with him as a specimen of the
house which he wanted to sell. It is
needless to dwell, however, upon this
influence, important and ennobling
though it be, because its tendency is
to keep alive the memory of the past;
and we wish rather to indicate the
new life that is stirring. Albert
Smith’s Ascent of Mont Blanc is the
best specimen of a class of entertainments
that are now very popular—perhaps
the most popular of all, and
which, when further and duly developed,
promise to rival the present
theatres. Mr Albert Smith goes to
Mont Blanc, returns, gets Mr Beverley
to paint the scenes through which he
travelled, and enlivens those scenes
by the description and impersonation
of what he saw and heard. We have
no doubt that Mr Smith’s entertainment
is far more amusing, far more
intellectual, and ten thousand times
more artistic, than anything of the
kind which England could furnish in
the thirteenth or fourteenth century;
and he will not resent the comparison
if we say that he reminds us of
the holy palmers and pilgrims who,
in those crusading centuries, returned
from Palestine, and with the aid of
rude pictures—“the city of Jerusalem,
with towers and pinnacles,—Old
Tobye’s House,—A Fyrmament with
a fyry cloud, and a double cloud,”—attempted
in miracle plays and mysteries
to convey an idea of the scenes
they themselves had witnessed in the
Holy Land, or of the events which
in the olden time had been enacted
there, and so laid the foundations of a
theatre that ultimately grew into the
fair proportions of the Elizabethan
drama, as the rude earthwork which
Romulus in the Palilia founded on
the Palatine, grew in greatness and
in pride, until it embraced the seven
hills, a city of palaces and the marble
mistress of the world. We might
have run the comparison still more
closely, if we had not forgotten for
the moment Mr Smith’s Eastern Travels
and Overland Route. No matter.
In these entertainments we find a
certain resemblance to the miracle plays
out of which the modern drama
was developed; and do we not also
find a certain nineteenth century
likeness of the ancient moralities, in
these life-dramas, death-dramas, and
devil-dramas, in which our young
poets delight to sow their wild oats;
giving us all manner of caprices for
imagination, hysterics for passion,
revolting descriptions for the sublime,
soliloquy for dialogue, and dialogue
for action? Yea, verily, and out of
all these elements we are not without
hope that a drama may yet
arise more worthy of fame than
that which at present exists. But
again, we repeat, no more Shakespearean
imitations, and legitimate
suicide; let the dramatists be wise
in their generation, accept the tendencies
of the time, and think the
thoughts and wear the dress of this
year 1856.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>LESSONS FROM THE WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The glimpse of peace just afforded
us is almost as startling as the news
of battle, so general has been the impression
that the war must inevitably
continue. Peace on such
satisfactory grounds as are probable
will descend on the heated nation
like dew. Those who, after sending
forth their sons, brothers, lovers, to
the war, have been steeling themselves
in the Spartan school, scarcely
daring to hope again to see their
soldier alive and unwounded, trying
to believe that if they see him no
more they will lament for him only
with the chastened grief due to him
who falls in arms, will have all their
sternness melted in their breasts to
warm soft hope. The soldier himself,
shivering on those desolate
Crimean plains before an invisible
foe, and casting many a prolonged
mental glance to the homes of England,
will see the red glories of the
anticipated campaign contrasted vividly
with the cool fresh tints of
peace—peace, a word to him suggestive
hitherto of dim and dubious
delights, once his, but perhaps to be
his no more, and only to be dwelt on
for a few short moments when some
echo from England had quenched the
ever-present din of arms. And, to
touch on lower though yet more
wide-spreading interests, there are
many to whom the sordid thought,
that they will no more be called on
to contribute the share of expense
which, in one form or another, was
exacted from them by the war, will
bring more pleasure than any accession
of glory to England. For ourselves,
peace on the basis of unconditional
acceptance by Russia of the
terms dictated by Austria, will leave
us nothing to regret. But, turning
for a space from this newer topic, let
us glance at the position in which
these chances of peace have found
us, and speak, as it is still sound
policy to speak, as though there
were certain to be war in the coming
year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like one who struggles in a fog
through a quagmire, England has
passed through the late campaign.
Advancing a few paces, plunging
waist deep, pausing in bewilderment,
tenfold increased by the clamour of
the volunteer guides who throng
officiously to the brink, and, if often
supported, yet also sometimes encumbered,
by the companion-hand
linked in hers, she has attained a
temporary halting-place. Myriad-voiced
instructions, mostly resolving
themselves into the simple and valuable
injunction to “go in and win,”
were, up to Russia’s acceptance of
the proposals, still echoing from all
points of the compass—many a
lantern, trustworthy as an <i><span lang="la">ignis
fatuus</span></i>, glimmered through the surrounding
mist. Disregarding for a
time the well-meant attentions of
these numerous advisers, we may attempt
to throw on the devious track
of the past some light uncoloured by
the tints of party-spirit or of popular
feeling, and so try to obtain some
guidance for the future.</p>

<p class='c009'>Glancing at the past year, we see
the British army in new and strange
alliance with its foe of centuries.
Its leaders were either untried men,
or men from whom, as previous trial
had shown, nothing very remarkable
was to be expected. Under such
circumstances, the army was required
to satisfy the expectations, not merely
of a sovereign or a government, but
a people. Accepting it as inevitable
that the people will, in the absence
of a strong government, virtually
charge themselves with the conduct
of the war, let us at least attempt to
infuse into the collective wisdom of
the nation the elements of deliberation,
wholesome doubt, and self-restraint.
To speak either of the
pity or the scorn with which the
more thoughtful and comprehensive
order of spirits view a whole people,
who claim to be the heirs of vast
experience and civilisation, blindly
clamouring after some blind leader
at every turn of affairs, might answer
no other purpose than to excite
popular hostility. Yet to know that
many of those to whom the nation
cannot refuse its respect view with
contempt, regret, or compassion the
ordinary expression of popular opinion—to
know that its most positive
enunciations are held as akin to the
sagacity of Dogberry and Verges—to
know that the angels may well be
deemed to weep at the consequences
of its fantasies—might excite, even
in the most determined advocate of
the might, majesty, and power of
the people, some obscure sensation
of self-distrust and shame.</p>

<p class='c009'>After for many years regarding
their army either with indifference
or dislike, and systematically confining
it within the narrowest limits
possible, the English people, at the
outbreak of the war, dismissed their
troops to the scene of action with
such boastful applause as would have
been unbecoming if offered by a nation
which had made military glory
its chief aim, to a veteran army habituated
to victory. Anticipations
were raised which it would be nearly
impossible to realise, and to fall
short of which would be disgrace.
Forty years before, a small English
army, composed of marvellous troops
led by a marvellous man, had stemmed
the progress of Napoleon, achieving
exploits which, though meeting
at the time with much detraction,
eventually raised our soldiers to the
first rank in the estimation of the
world. Since then, public attention
had been turned to totally different
matters with great success; and we
had distinguished ourselves by so
many achievements in science and
art, and had become so accustomed
to lead the way in the pursuits of
peace, that for any power to presume
to dispute our supremacy was
regarded as an impertinence calling
for a chastisement, the promptness
and weight of which it would be
absurd to doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hitherto our object had been to
attain a military establishment which
should offer no shadow of offence to
the most enthusiastic admirer of
liberty, or the most ardent votary of
progress. When with this object it
was found desirable to combine the
totally different one of possessing an
irresistible force in war, some error
was apparent in the result of the process;
and the first impulse of our
philosophic and reasoning nation was
anger—at first directed on no one in
particular, but after a time on all
concerned in the conduct of the war,
without any other distinction of persons
than that arising from the respective
shares borne in its administration,
and consequent amount of
presumed criminality. By some unknown
process of logic, it was concluded
that a sweeping change in the
conductors of the war would restore
our credit as a military power, and
that a general and minister or two
officially buried would be as the
dragon’s teeth, from whence heroes
would spring. Accordingly, some
were dismissed, and some abused,
<i><span lang="fr">pour encourager les autres</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Public attention was now riveted
closely on the war, to the absolute
exclusion of all other topics. Intelligence
of all kinds was eagerly demanded;
and those whose business
it is to supply the want, could, with
all their efforts, scarcely write up to
the demand. Private correspondence
from the seat of war was eagerly
sought and extensively published, and
columns set apart for “Letters from
the Camp;” the special correspondence
of the daily press was copied
into other journals; leading articles
in periodicals daily, weekly, and
monthly, were founded on the information
thus received, and the exaggerated
statements were sometimes
coloured still more highly; and
popular opinion, thus originated and
formed, began to exercise so powerful
a pressure on the Parliament and
the Government, that a glance at
its sources becomes especially important.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is useless to argue the question of
whether it is on the whole more advantageous
to publish or to suppress intelligence
of the projected operations,
or the state of the army, since the
public curiosity on these heads will
continue to be gratified at all hazards.
The best means were adopted for
obtaining intelligence, and conveying
it in a pleasant form. The special
correspondents of the newspapers
are of course men of great ability.
No expense or trouble would be
spared to secure writers capable of
satisfying the high requirements of
the daily press; and their letters
from the camp display great literary
power. As pictures of life in the
field, their correspondence is of the
greatest value; as a guide to public
opinion on the progress of the war,
we may, without offence, consider it
far less satisfactory. No one pretends
that these gentlemen possessed either
any exclusive means of obtaining information,
or any aptitude for judging
of the nature, progress, and success
of the operations they witnessed,
beyond that which any intelligent
spectator might claim. The language
in which they talk of the operations
of the campaign is rather a military
slang than the technical expression
of military art, and resembles the
latter only as the work of a poetaster
resembles that of a poet. Nothing
would be easier than to make a collection
of leading articles founded on
the information thus derived, and
show them to be a mere jumble of
absurdity. Yet this was the kind of
writing which, by appealing to a
circle of readers sufficiently large to
constitute the public, exercised an
important effect on the administration
of the war. Very different was
the style of an article which appeared
in the <cite>Moniteur</cite>, descriptive of the
conduct of the campaign, the facts of
which were supplied apparently from
public documents, and which was
evidently written by a man of military
attainments.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be scarcely fair to criticise
closely the letters of officers,
which, intended only for the perusal
of their friends at home, were often,
by the indiscretion of those friends,
and to the annoyance of the writers,
made public. It is a very common
and excusable weakness for a man to
avail himself, perhaps unconsciously,
of a little exaggeration in the incidents
he describes, when by so doing
he may become a greater hero to the
domestic circle; an exaltation which,
far from doing harm to any one,
forms one of the cases where it is delightful
to be imposed on. Each
family that has a member serving
with the army, sees but one figure in
the foreground of every scene of the
campaign. In success the figure is a
hero, in time of suffering a martyr.
Every one likes to appear in the former
character; but there were some
who, during the most trying period
of the campaign, too solicitous for
sympathy, gave vent to lamentations
which, if fortitude under privation
be a virtue, must be considered unsoldierlike
and unmanly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon such correspondence were
founded the lucubrations of those
writers at home who undertook to
instruct us on the war; and if military
science be necessary to a right
understanding of military affairs, they
must be admitted to be deficient in
an important element. We put the
case hypothetically, because, if military
science be necessary to a right
understanding of military affairs,
many of our self-constituted teachers
must be convicted of presumptuous
absurdity. Men who would never
think of interfering with the most
obscure country doctor in his treatment
of their sick friend—who would
trust blindly to their legal adviser in
a question threatening character or
property—who employ architects to
plan their houses, and masons to
build them, and, if the structure do
not answer their expectations, never
think of insinuating that they could
have done it better themselves, are
all ready to originate or amend the
plan of a campaign, to censure those
intrusted with its conduct, and to
interfere in its most technical particulars.
Clergymen, whose warfare
has hitherto been waged only with
the enemy of mankind, expatiate
largely on the best mode of annoying
our material foe; doctors abandon
the study of the nervous for that of
the military system; and Satan’s
occupation of finding mischief for
idle hands is for the present gone;
for every idler thinks himself competent
to discuss and advise in a
military question. Modest men, diffident
of giving opinions even on subjects
open to general discussion, may
be heard in all companies, praising
and condemning with the confidence
of the most accomplished critics.
All are ready to quote in support of
their views the opinions of the most
celebrated generals; yet, while mentioning
them with the greatest respect,
seem to think that excellence
in the profession in which they earned
their reputation is attainable by the
lowest capacity. A certain degree
of reserve is generally practised by
those who undertake to instruct the
public on topics of popular interest,
but no man seems to doubt the
genuineness of his inspiration on
any present, past, or future phase of
the war; and in pamphlet, letter,
or leader, he hastens to impart his
light.</p>

<p class='c009'>While regarding the pretensions of
these tacticians and strategists as
about as respectable as those of barber-surgeons
in pharmacy, inspired
cobblers in religion, or gypsies in divination,
we do not think that any
amount of study or previous training
renders a man’s opinions really valuable,
unless he has personally visited
the scene of war, and is acquainted
with the topographical features of
the theatre of operations. Such an
acquaintance as we speak of, neither
descriptions nor maps can adequately
afford. We have known instances
where military men of great ability
or experience, whose attention had
been closely riveted on the conduct
of the war, entertained ideas respecting
the feasibility of certain operations,
which an hour’s glance at the
ground would at once have convinced
them were erroneous, and
which they relinquished after conversing
with officers from the Crimea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus glanced at the unsatisfactory
nature of the grounds on
which the public form opinions on
the war, we may point out some of
the errors most strongly persisted in.
Up to the present time, referring to
the Russian attack on the Turkish
outposts before Balaklava, it is constantly
asserted that the loss of the
Woronzoff road, which the presence
of the Russians on the neighbouring
ridge of hills rendered too precarious
for the transport of convoys, was a
principal cause of the subsequent
disasters and sufferings of the army.
Now the Woronzoff road is nowhere
less distant than between three or
four miles from Balaklava; and the
intervening space is as badly adapted
for the construction of a road as any
part of the plains or heights,—worse
indeed than most; so that, until it
is shown that we possessed the means
of uniting Balaklava with the Woronzoff
road by a practicable road, we
cannot be proved to have suffered
materially by the presence of the Russians
there. Liprandi’s movement,
in occupying these hills, is generally
regarded as a stroke of generalship,
creditable to him, and damaging to
the Allies; but it would be difficult
to point to any commensurate effect
resulting from his movement; while
many officers—General Bosquet, we
believe, among the rest—considered
he had laid himself open to a defeat;
and on a subsequent view of the
ground, at the reconnaissance made
by Omer Pasha in April, regrets
were loudly expressed by both
French and English that Liprandi
should have been permitted to decamp
unmolested.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Another delusion which took complete
possession of the public was,
that Balaklava was constantly in
peril, and that the Russians could
easily attack it. The map showed a
road from thence along the coast towards
Yalta, and it was supposed
the enemy could approach it in that
direction. But this road, narrow,
stony, and broken, was naturally
very difficult even for field-artillery,
and was easily to be rendered totally
impracticable; while the right of the
intrenchments surrounding Balaklava,
crossing this road, with two advanced
stockades looking upon a deep
and narrow glen on one side, and the
sea-cliffs on the other, along which
the path wound precariously, rendered
a successful attack impossible.
Thus Balaklava could only be attacked
in front directly down the
valley; on entering which, supposing
the intrenchments to be won,
the enemy would have found themselves
in a defile, with steep rocky
sides; in their front the harbour,
and in their rear the plain stretching
to the Tchernaya, across which
the Allies, descending in superior
force from the plateau, might throw
themselves, and so enclose the assailants.</p>

<p class='c009'>More lately, the public has been
persuaded that a direct advance
against the Russian position was
practicable; and that, if it were
deemed unadvisable so to attack
the position, it might easily be
turned. Consequently, the advance
of the French to the Belbek, after
the conclusion of the siege, was
watched with extreme interest at
home, and great disappointment was
felt when no result was attained.
Yet those on the spot who had viewed
the ground could have entertained
no expectation of any success—must
rather, indeed, have felt satisfaction
that the French right, after being so
extended, was withdrawn without
disaster within the range surrounding
the valley of Baidar. For if the reader,
taking his map, will trace the line of
heights extending from Inkermann by
Mackenzie’s Farm to the Belbek, and
will then imagine them to terminate
at top in a steep perpendicular wall
of chalky cliff, supporting the large
plateau extending all round to the
Belbek valley, on which the Russians
were encamped—and will also observe
that the one path up the plateau
is guarded by the enemy, and
the few narrow defiles which penetrate
the heights are also held by
them—he will have no difficulty in
perceiving that to extend the Allied
right was to give the enemy an opportunity,
instantly perceived from
their exalted point of view, of concentrating
at the required point a superior
force, marching through the defiles,
and cutting off, or directly attacking,
the French corps operating
in advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>These errors, although mortifying,
and rendering the public unreasonably
dissatisfied, produced no other
ill consequences. But there have
been other delusions, as obstinately
maintained, the unfortunate results
of which are but too visible. Such
is the constant comparison to our
disadvantage drawn between ourselves
and the French. This is obviously
a delicate subject to deal
with, when an endeavour to be just
to ourselves must almost necessarily
offend our allies, whose own tact and
good feeling have prevented them
from adopting even the faintest echo
of the depreciatory clamour raised
by our countrymen, and would be ill
repaid by invidious remarks. Yet
surely we may be allowed to remind
our readers that, in all the actions in
the field during the earlier stage of
the campaign, the English bore the
brunt of the battle. Without offence,
too, we may point to the records of
the siege to prove that the French
suffered repulses, on more than one
occasion, no less sanguinary and discouraging
than ours from the Redan:
such, for instance, as the attack on
the hills known afterwards as the
White Works, east of Careening Bay,
where our allies were defeated with
slaughter, and did not renew the
attack. Nor do we see any impolicy
in asking what would have been the
feeling in England, judging from its
expression since, if it had been our
batteries, instead of those of the
French, which were silenced after a
few hours’ fire at the commencement
of the siege on the 17th of October?
What indignation! what sarcasm!
what abuse of our generals, engineers,
and artillery! what glowing caustic
eulogies of our gallant allies, depicted
as maintaining the contest single-handed,
and generously continuing
their own fire to save their crushed
and discomfited coadjutors from total
ruin, though the ammunition, so
scarce then in the trenches, and so
painfully accumulated, was thereby
expended without hope of success!
Had the reverse of this picture at
that time been drawn, it would have
been highly impolitic, but perfectly
true. And let us also allude to the
report, which we believe to be an
arrant falsehood, of English soldiers
being protected from the first rigours
of winter by French uniforms—and
to the utter and apparently systematic
disregard of all aid conferred by us
on our allies—to show the important
nature of which, we need only remind
our readers of the number of powerful
guns, and the vast quantities of
ammunition, with which we, at various
periods of the siege, furnished the
French batteries. Too little stress
has also been laid on the superiority
we may venture to claim for the fire
of our artillery throughout the siege:
a superiority always apparent to
those who watched the practice of
the batteries from commanding
points. That the services of our siege-artillery
were appreciated by the
French, is evident from the published
despatch of Sir Richard Dacres,
where it is stated that the assistance
rendered by our fire was often warmly
acknowledged by the French commanders.
But where, in press or
people, are we to expect the echoes
of applause?</p>

<p class='c009'>Again, to pass from particular instances
to a wider field, let us inquire
into the grounds of the preference so
invariably and strenuously shown for
the French military system, as having
proved itself very superior to our
own. Where, we would ask, is the
evidence of this superiority? Has it
appeared in the production of great
generals? We really believe the
French army would be as much
puzzled as the English to select a
man, young, enterprising, experienced,
scientific, and sagacious, to be to it a
tower of strength, and an assurance
of victory. We know the English
regimental officers to be younger
than the French, whose system entails
the existence of old subalterns
and venerable captains: we know
that ours are no less gallant than
theirs: nor can an instance be pointed
out where our discipline has appeared
to disadvantage beside theirs.
Let us at once record our opinion
that no troops in Europe are more
subordinate, better disciplined, or
better led, than ours—and we will
not do the gallant gentlemen who lead
them the wrong to suppose that a
different education, or a larger infusion
from the ranks, would tend to
exalt the valour or the morale of our
army.</p>

<p class='c009'>While we at once grant that our
commanders have failed to display
any great genius in the war,
we think the treatment of them
by the public altogether unreasonable.
Gentlemen stricken in
years, who have never in their
lives been distinguished for anything
in particular, and who have spent
half a century in the world without
impressing their nearest relations or
most intimate friends with the idea
that they possess remarkable capacity,
far less genius, are suddenly
placed in a position demanding a rare
union of high qualities. This sudden
elevation of course fails to elicit what
they never claimed to possess—and
men who would have passed most
respectably through the more sequestered
walks of life, are suddenly
covered with obloquy, because they
do not exhibit, on their giddy eminence,
that mastery over men and
circumstances of which few examples
are vouchsafed to the world in
a century.</p>

<p class='c009'>To point out how the public has
been as indiscriminate and unreasonable
in its praise as its censure, would
be a more invidious task. But it
has frequently happened, that the
eulogies showered on some fortunate
individual have not been endorsed
by the opinion of the army. Reputations,
beginning nobody knows
how, have taken shape and substance.
The mischief of this is, that these
will be the men selected for trust in
a future emergency. Where there is
so little opportunity for individuals
to distinguish themselves, chance confers
a small prominence on some who,
thus lifted from the level of the
crowd, become marked men—and to
be marked where there is so little
competition is to be famous. To us
who note this, all history grows a
chapter of accidents: we have an
uneasy doubt whether Horatius really
did keep the bridge, or Leonidas the
pass—how much of his fame Coriolanus
may owe to aristocratic connection,
Scipio to his relation with a
forgotten war-minister, or Alcibiades
to private interest at the Athenian
Horse Guards. Still, it is well to
find that the public, with all its disposition
to censure, retains the desire
to praise; and we are the less
disposed to except against its encomiums,
because we should be
puzzled to show how they might be
better directed. The campaign has
been singularly barren of opportunity
for showing capacity. In most
cases some divisions of an invading
army possess a certain independence
of movement, and their commanders
have a field for showing their powers.
Advanced guards from these and
from the main body are commanded
by officers of lower rank, who, in the
attack or defence of a farm or a
village, in the passage of a difficult
stream, in the surprise of a convoy,
or the collection of information, have
an opportunity of displaying their
qualities. But in the advance from
Old Fort, the army marched entire
across wide open plains, seeing only
the retiring skirmishers of the enemy,
entering abandoned villages, and passing
the different natural obstacles
unmolested, except at the Alma.
None of the sense of enterprise, and
of being engaged in scientific operations,
which lends such glow and interest
to civilised warfare, animated
the troops traversing these desolate
regions. Extensive plains, vast fields
of coppice, or tumbled masses of
hills, unbrightened by spots of culture
or signs of human habitation,
almost destitute even of roads, spread
round the army, which dwindled to
insignificance in the large sweep of
the monotonous horizon. Then came
the eleven months’ siege, when the
prescribed daily duty of the trenches
left no field open for invention, resource,
or sagacity. In such circumstances,
military genius remained
latent in the army. That it exists
we have no doubt; and we should
expect in the course of another campaign
to see brows, now perchance
obscure, wreathed with merited
laurels; but whether any truly great
general, such as Wellington, Marlborough,
or Napoleon is to be found
in either army, is a point of which
we may well doubt, when we remember
how rare such beings are—how
happy must be the combination
of circumstances which lifts them to
the point where they are recognised,
and that we live, moreover, in an age
when those pre-eminent spirits, which
become landmarks for time, seem almost
to have ceased their visits to
earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime it is curious to observe
how the nation, uneasy at being
baulked of its desire for a leader,
proposes to make good the deficiency.
Besides the somewhat arbitrary and
unpromising plan already alluded
to, of seizing upon ordinary men and
commanding them to become great
by virtue of their position and responsibility,
other methods are proposed
for eliciting the sparks of
genius. The most favourite scheme
at present is the education of our
officers. Masters are appointed to
examine candidates for commissions
in different branches of science and
literature; and, from the specimens
we have seen of the examination
papers, we may expect, supposing
a reasonable proportion of the
questions to be answered, shortly
to see some very erudite men in
the army, for it appears to us that
the heart of the Admirable Crichton
would have broke before he had got
through a tithe of them. What shadow
of a chance would the most
accomplished Russian officer have, if
opposed to a man who could, offhand,
“write a short life of Milton,
with dates,” “perform the eudiometric
analysis of atmospheric
air,” “tell what smoky quartz is,”
“give a summary of Cousin’s argument
against the philosophy of
Locke,” and “draw a map of Britain
in the time of the Roman occupation:”
which are a few of the
achievements demanded of the candidates
in August 1855. “What
is the origin of Roman satire?” is
asked of the military aspirant by
the Rev. G. Butler, one of the examiners,
who, we should think, possibly
became, on the occasion, the
origin of some English satire. “Compose,”
says another of them, the Rev.
C. Trench, “an essay which shall
not exceed thirty lines, on the following
subject: In what way may England
hope to avoid such a conflict
with her colonies as led to the American
War of Independence?” We hope
Mr Labouchere will at once see the
propriety of resigning his post to the
author of the prize essay on this subject,
whose faculty of compendiously
settling such knotty points, in thirty
lines, would be invaluable in the
colonial, or any other department of
State. “What is the object,” asks
J. D. Morell, Esq., “which Kant
proposed to himself in writing the
<cite>Critick of Pure Reason</cite>?” to point
out which might possibly have
been acceptable to Kant himself.
The Rev. R. W. Browne, after demanding
an explanation of the terms,
“Rhapsodist,” and “Cyclian Poet,”
asks, “What are the conditions most
favourable to the growth of epic
poetry?” the best answer to which
we shall be happy to accept as an
article for the Magazine, as also the
reply to the demand of A. H. Clough,
Esq., for “a history of translations
into English,” which we will publish
in parts. Under these new conditions
we are certainly likely to
get commanders such as the world
never saw before. Fancy the bewilderment
of poor old Jomini, prince
of strategists, at being required to
tell the Rev. G. Butler what he knew
“of the military organisation of the
Samnites,”—or the perplexity of the
Duke of Wellington, when requested
by the Rev. Mr Browne to “illustrate
from Homer the respect paid to the
rites of hospitality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fact is, we do not anticipate
from the educational plan, the happy
results which seem to be generally
looked for, the reasons for which
have been given fully in the well-considered
article “On the State
of the British Army,” in our last
Number. We fear that the best
of the candidates might still be a
poor creature or a prig, perfectly inoffensive,
but no more capable of infusing
confidence into an army than
his grandmother. The spell which
is to evoke the coming leader has not
yet been framed—he will appear, as
heretofore, when time and the hour
shall bring him. While we are seeking
him with spectacles and lantern,
now in this corner, now in that, grasping
what we think to be him, but
which turns out to be a post, we
shall hear in the distance his strong
clear voice, dispelling doubt. And
O that he were come! What order
out of chaos, what confidence out of
confusion, what reverential silence out
of senseless clamour, what strength,
hope, and trust, would attend his
victorious steps! Now we know what
gratitude is due to him who can
wield firmly and gloriously the might
of England,—now we know that
dukedoms, Strathfieldsayes, garters,
and uncounted honours, are all too
little to acknowledge our debt to the
bold sagacious spirit which can animate
and direct our powers, else
blind, diffused, and enervate.</p>

<p class='c009'>We choose this juncture to attempt
to instil into the public mind some
doubt of its own cherished convictions,
because those convictions may
at present lead to consequences we
would gladly avert. There is an
idea abroad that the past campaign
leaves us failures to be retrieved,
glory to be recovered, and influence
to be restored, and that another is
necessary to set us once more on our
accustomed pinnacle. In vain have
we written, if it be not clear that we
cannot share the popular feeling of
discontent, either at the course of
the war, or the prospects of peace.
While Russia was stubborn, haughty,
and repellant, none raised their voices
more loudly than we, for prompt,
vigorous, and sustained efforts against
the foe. Now that she is willing to
treat on bases which will insure to
the Allies all the objects they took
up arms to attain, we should be false
to our own policy and convictions
did we desire to continue the war
upon the new ground, that fresh victory
is necessary to our reputation.
There is a vile savour of defeat about
the sentiment, ill becoming a nation
which has just borne its share in a
great and successful feat of arms;
and we repudiate it the more scornfully,
because we can trace so clearly
any loss of prestige we may have
sustained, to the false and self-depreciatory
outcries of our own ill-informed
and ill-judging countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The plans of that coming campaign,
if haply it is still to be, are now being
settled by the council sitting in Paris.
On the alternatives which present
themselves to that council we have
cast many an attentive and eager
glance. First, with regard to the
present theatre of operations, we have
long considered an advance from our
present position before Sebastopol
impossible, partly for reasons already
given in speaking of the expectations
raised after the capture of the town.
To advance from Eupatoria in great
force is also probably impracticable,
from the want of water in supply
sufficiently frequent and copious to
satisfy the requirements of a large
army. There remains, then, only the
Kertch peninsula as a base of operations,
to which we must shift the mass
of our army. That a campaign from
thence would result in the conquest
of the Crimean peninsula, we do not
doubt. But two considerations arise:
First, supposing the Crimea in the
hands of the Allies, will not its disposal
be a source of embarrassment,
far from compensated for by the advantage
of possessing it? Secondly,
with Sebastopol wrested from her,
her fleet destroyed, and her coasts
blockaded, is not the Crimea already
virtually lost to Russia? As to the
first question, often discussed as we
have heard it, we have never yet
caught even a glimpse of a satisfactory
solution. Joint occupation,
possession granted to any one of the
different powers, all expedients that
present themselves, contain difficulties
which would render any advantage
accruing to us from its being so
held, small in the balance. And
what would that advantage be, beyond
what the footing we have there
already gives us? We can maintain
a force as easily at Kamiesch as at
Perekop, thus preventing Russia from
re-occupying the great prize of the
campaign, the “standing menace to
Turkey;” and as to the loss to our
enemy in being deprived of the Crimea,
we have frequently expressed
our opinion that, in holding territory
so distant and difficult of access, she
incurs loss far heavier than that of
the prestige or dominion which would
fall from her with the peninsula.
The vast and ruinous efforts which
she made before the fall of the city
were indeed justified rather by the
importance which the possession of
Sebastopol had obtained in the negotiations
than by its real value;
those efforts may have had no small
effect in inducing her present concessions;
and to continue them would,
in our view, be a draining and exhaustive
policy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The war in Asia offers a more alluring
field of enterprise and achievement.
None of those difficulties beset
us at the outset which render the
Crimean campaign such an uphill
game. To recover Kars, to match
our troops against the enemy in the
open field, and to force them struggling
back upon the Caucasus, forms
a brilliant and attractive programme.
But has France a sufficient interest
in a campaign in Asia to induce her
to join in it? Will she not say that
British interests are mainly at stake
here, and that, to her, Russian progress
in Asia is comparatively a matter
of indifference? And, if she
takes this view, will it suit her to sit
idly by, while the British army engrosses
all the interest and glory
which have such powerful allurements
for the soldiers and people of
France? But, whether our allies join
us in such a campaign, or permit
us to prosecute it alone, it is worth
while to consider whether the advantages
to be gained, either in the
shape of positive successes or losses
suffered by our adversary, are such
as to compensate for the drain our
army will suffer in a year of the
most favourable and triumphant warfare
in Asia.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third important point open to
attack is the fortress of Nicolaieff, the
great naval arsenal and dockyard of
Russia in the Black Sea. And if
we had a voice in the Allied councils,
on no point should we speak with
more confidence and decision than in
positively objecting to another great
siege, jointly undertaken. In the
first place, the French will always so
far outnumber us as to be able to lay
claim, and to establish their claim,
to a far greater share of the weight,
the conduct, and the glory of the
enterprise. Then, as before, the
English people, growing impatient,
probably, at the necessarily slow progress
of siege operations, filled, with
the wildest expectations, and often
doomed to find them disappointed,
will once more give vent to their
chagrin, by depreciating the exertions
of their army; and they will
again be suicidally successful in lowering
their own military prestige,
which this second campaign was to
restore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus reviewed the possible
theatres of operation, and weighed
the successes to be gained against the
sacrifices in achieving them, we have
acquired the conviction that there is
a method by which we shall more
damage our adversary with less injury
to ourselves than by any of
these enterprises. Leaving an Allied
garrison within the lines of Kamiesch,
watching and harassing the coasts of
the Euxine and the Sea of Azoff with
a squadron of light vessels, and aiding
the Turks with a large contingent,
we would gladly see the Allied
powers agreeing to withdraw their
forces simultaneously from that distant
and now unsatisfactory scene of
operations, and to convert the war
into a blockade. Deprived of all
exercise for her military strength,
which would then become to her an
encumbrance, debarred from commerce,
and incapable of injuring her
adversaries, Russia would lie like a
huge corpse rotting on the face of
Europe—or a Titan chained to a
rock, unable to scare away the assailant
that rent his vitals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already we are beginning to lose
sight of the objects with which we
commenced the war: not for territorial
aggrandisement, not for glory,
not for augmentation of influence or
prestige, not even for that which
seems now to be so generally regarded
as desirable, the ruin or deep
injury of Russia, but for the security
of Turkey against an act of oppression.
Surely a war may be carried
on fully in earnest without desiring
the utter destruction of the foe; and
there has been nothing in the course
of hostilities to justify such deadly
exasperation. Our object, always
plain and direct, is not to destroy,
but to coerce Russia. If she is now
ready to make the required concessions,
we can see no just or politic
reason for continuing the war; if she
be not ready to do so, we think the
course we have pointed out the best
and safest for obliging her to submit.
In either case, we should welcome
with joy the gallant army of the
Crimea. With such a force ready in
these islands for defence or aggression,
what power would then dare to
act on the presumption that England’s
prestige has diminished?
Come what come may, though fear of
change should perplex the monarchs
of Europe, and the elements of discord
be loosed, our power would be
founded as the rock. Girt by such a
fleet as never before floated, and
guarded by the best appointed army
we ever possessed, we might bid defiance
to the world in arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in either case, also, we trust
the sharp and heavy lessons of the
war will not be lost upon us. To
speak at present with due contempt
of those advocates of peace and utility,
once so loud and confident, now
so downcast and bedraggled, would
be like painting the lily, or heaping
ridicule on Pantaloon. Yet let the
present fever once pass, and we fear,
unless stimulants are applied, the
old lethargy will return. And
therefore we say, whether there be
peace, or war to obtain peace, let our
military power be not only maintained,
but augmented. Let us not again
be caught asleep, and with our quiver
empty. Let those who so strongly
insist on placing our army in depreciatory
comparison with that of
France, study the comparative circumstances
of the two armies before
the war began. They will find among
our neighbours no skeleton of an
army, no weak sketch or outline of
what should be a cavalry, no neglected
or half-equipped artillery, no insufficient
medical staff, and no defunct
commissariat. Let men who cheerfully
pay the premium of fire insurance,
to secure themselves against
the chance of conflagration, learn to
regard as equally thrifty the maintenance
of a safeguard against the explosive
elements so rife in Europe.
Let our army be so modelled and provided
in peace, that it may readily
assume the proportions of war.
And, above all, let us devise some
means, more efficient than any we
now possess, for recruiting our
regiments, and rendering military
service more alluring to our population.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us also, when peace returns,
think and speak of our national
achievements during the war, in a
tone equally removed from the vainglorious
outcry which heralded imaginary
successes, and the sullen
whimperings which are now heard
for a presumed discomfiture. “We
may find in these achievements
ample reason for congratulation.
That the army was few and ill-provided,
only augments the glories
of Alma and Inkermann. At three
thousand miles from home we
landed that army on the territory
of the greatest military power in
Europe, and laid siege to his naval
stronghold. Amid the snows of
winter and the heats of summer the
siege advanced: not for a day, since
the army landed, have our guns been
silent; not for a day have the waters of
the enemy’s coasts been unfurrowed
by our keels, bearing ammunition to
the batteries and supplies to our
troops. On a spot separated from
us by the Atlantic, the Mediterranean,
and the Euxine, we have maintained
our army, more than supplied its
losses, poured into the country the
largest ordnance and projectiles in
steady and enormous profusion. And
when these had done their work,
when the town for which the Czar
disputed with desperate and exhaustive
efforts was abandoned in ruins
and ashes, a larger force than England
ever before possessed, rested for
the winter amid those distant regions
in comfort and plenty. Such, broadly
stated, are among the marvellous exploits
which England has achieved in
the war.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>RELIGION IN COMMON LIFE.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are few things more difficult
to understand and acknowledge
than the essentially one and indivisible
nature of that puzzling
personage, Man, with all his diverse
occupations. An ingenious
process of mental anatomy, carefully
distributing to every pursuit its little
bundle of faculties—his head to his
business, his heart to his home, and
to his religion a vague ethereal principle,
which, for want of a better title,
we call his soul—seems always to
have been a more agreeable idea to
the philosophic and speculative, than
that bolder presentment of one whole
indivisible being, which calls the man
to love his Maker “with all his heart,
with all his soul, with all his strength,
and with all his mind.” We prefer,
with instinctive subtilty—for human
nature has wiles in its weakness—the
easier morality of division; and a
hundred distinctions straightway
start up for the confusion of the one
poor individual creature, who indeed
is little able to bear, in any of his
occupations, the subtraction of any
of his powers. But the issue is that
we cheat the world when we only
mean to cheat God, and lose the
genial and joyous privilege to “do all
things heartily,” while we calculate
with trembling how much belongs
to Religion, and how much to Common
Life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not to say that Common Life has
always borne somewhat of a contemptible
aspect to the philosophy
of men: asceticism is more than a
Romish error—it is a natural delusion
as universal as the race; and
however dubious we may be about
the hermit’s cell and its mortifications,
a dainty oratory, calm and
secluded, a little world of Thought or
of Art, commends itself much to the
imagination of the “superior classes”
even in these progressive times. Our
modern prophets appeal to a select
and refined audience, and have nothing
to say to the crowd. We have
abundant missions to the <em>poor</em>, but
few loving assaults upon the <em>common</em>.
Strange enough, we are all best
satisfied to go out of our way in the
service of God and our neighbour—and
tasks <em>outré</em> and self-imposed are
more pleasant to our perversity at all
times than those that lie direct in
our path.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among all the vague big utterances
of the day, professing so much
and profiting so little, it is pleasant
to fall upon anything so manful and
truth-telling as the little book whose
name stands at the head of our page.
And it startles us with a grateful
and pleasant surprise to see those
magical words of authority upon the
homely brown cover of Mr Caird’s
sermon, which, doubtless, despite all
our independence, have given it entrance
to many a house and table
where sermons are not generally
favoured reading. What is it which
has been honoured by “Her Majesty’s
Command?” It is not anything
addressed by special compliment
to Her Majesty; indeed—all
honour to the faithful preacher and
his royal auditors—one has to turn to
that same brown cover before one
has the least idea that such a rare
and exceptional personage as a Queen
was seated among the Aberdeenshire
lairds and peasants while Mr Caird
expounded the common way of life.
A throne is the most singular and
isolated of all human positions. To
us low down here in life’s protected
levels, there is no comprehending that
strange, lonely, lofty, imperial existence,
which knows no superior, nor
within its reach any equal; and
when the Sovereign, shut out from
lesser friendships, elects into one
great friend the vast crowd of her
people, one cannot refuse to be moved
by the noble simplicity of the expedient.
Other monarchs have done
it before Queen Victoria, but very
few with equal, and none with greater
success; and this sermon is a singular
present from a Prince to a Nation.
A condescending interest in our welfare,
and a certain solicitude for public
morality, are matter-of-course virtues
pertaining to the throne, whoever
may be its occupant; but a very
different and far deeper sentiment lies
in the heart of this distinct reference
to <em>our</em> understandings and sympathies,
which is the highest testimony of
satisfaction that the Queen and her
royal husband can give to an address
which moved and impressed themselves.
We are sufficiently accustomed
to the pure and dignified example
of our liege lady—sufficiently
acquainted with the wise exertions
of the Prince for the common weal—to
receive both without much demonstration;
but there is something
in the quiet humility and kindness
of this united action which touches
the heart of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>We honour the preacher, too
much absorbed with his greater
errand to take advantage of so
good an opportunity of paying court
to his Sovereign; and it is still
more honourable to the royal pair
who listened, that it was no disquisition
upon their own exalted office—no
enthusiastic voice of loyalty, urgent
upon the honours due to the
crown—nor indeed any discussion
whatever of the particular relationship
between monarch and people—which
moved them to this marked
and emphatic satisfaction. The Queen
presents to us earnestly, an address
in which herself is not distinguished
even by a complimentary inference—a
lesson unsoftened by the remotest
breath of flattery, and without even
a “special application.” God save the
Queen! We take our princely friend
at her word, acknowledging with
what a noble honesty she shares
with us, bearing her own full part of
all the daily duties of common life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Caird’s sermon strikes at the
very heart and root of all our living—it
is not a recommendation of good
things or good books, or any exclusive
manner of existence, but a simple
laying open of that great secret which
is the very atmosphere and breath of
religion. “Neither on this mountain
nor at Jerusalem, but in spirit and in
truth.” This preacher is not content
that anything which God has cleansed
should be called common or unclean—he
will not consent that a tithe
of our faculties and emotions, like
a tithe of our lands or our riches,
should be reserved for God, making
careful separation between the profane
and the holy. He is willing, as
Paul was, that we should have full
use of all our powers, which, Heaven
knows, are small enough for all that
has to be borne and done in this
laborious world. Strange argument
to quicken those dull toils which
even good men call secular and
worldly!—strange charm to speed
the plough, to guide the ship, to
hasten every day’s triumphant labours
through its full tale of animated
hours! “Whatsoever you do,
do it heartily, as unto the Lord, and
not unto men.” It is on this great
principle of life and labour that the
author of this able exposition founds
his reasonings, as he shows us how
well we may reconcile diligence in
business with fervour of spirit, and
brighten ordinary occupations with
the full force and radiance of godliness.
The lesson comes with especial
force in these days, when we are beguiled
by the most sweet voices of
the Ritualist and the Mystic on either
side of us, and are much persuaded
to a vulgar disparagement of the
honest necessary work of this earth.
How it may become holy work—and
how we ourselves, surrounded by its
cares, vexations, and trials, are in
reality placed in the most advantageous
position for proving and glorifying
our Lord and Leader, who had
share of all these labours before us, is
the burden of this message; and we
do not doubt it will show to many
men, how much nearer than they suspected,
even in their very hands and
households, if they will but do it, lies
the work of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Preachers and religious writers,
as a general principle, are strangely
timid of permitting to the Church
any intercourse, more than necessity
compels, with the world; and we
fear our good ministers would be
sadly disconcerted were they compelled
to consider with Paul what it
would be right to do, “if any of them
that believe not, bid you to a feast, and
ye be disposed to go”—a hypothesis
which, however, does not much alarm
the Apostle. But Mr Caird, with a
singular boldness, takes the very
“world itself—the coarse, profane,
common world, with its cares and
temptations, its rivalries and competitions,”
as the true “school for learning
the art” of religious living; and
is no advocate for theoretical and
self-secluding Christianity. “No
man,” he says, “can be a thorough
proficient in navigation who has never
been at sea, though he may learn the
theory of it at home. No man can
become a soldier by studying books
on military tactics in his closet; he
must in actual service acquire those
habits of coolness, courage, discipline,
address, rapid combination, without
which the most learned in the theory
of strategy or engineering will be but
a schoolboy soldier after all....
Tell us not, then, that
the man of business, the bustling
tradesman, the toil-worn labourer,
has little or no time to attend to religion.
As well tell us that the pilot,
amid the winds and storms, has no
leisure to attend to navigation—or
the general on the field of battle to
the art of war. When <em>will</em> he attend
to it? Religion is not a perpetual
moping over good books—religion
is not even prayer, praise, holy
ordinances: these are necessary to
religion—no man can be religious
without them. But religion, I repeat,
is mainly and chiefly the glorifying
God amid the duties and trials of
the world—the guiding our course
amid the adverse winds and currents
of temptation by the starlight of duty
and the compass of Divine truth—the
bearing us manfully, wisely,
courageously, for the honour of
Christ, our great Leader, in the
conflict of life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Wise doctrine, bold as it is wise;
but how strange is the popular impression
which makes cowardice, by
some strange magic, a Christian virtue,
and holds “he who fights and
runs away,” for the spiritual hero.
In everything else our hearts rise and
swell to trace the brave man’s progress
through deaths and perils; but
here we count it his best policy to
retreat into a corner, to thrust ambitions,
powers, and pleasures, tremulously
away from him, and “to be
religious.” To be religious!—the
word itself speaks eloquently of its
true meaning—a spirit potent, sweet,
and all-pervasive, and not a thing
or series of things,—yet notwithstanding
how eager we are to <em>do</em> instead
of to <em>be</em>, in this most momentous
matter. Mr Caird has finely discriminated
this life and soul of religion,
and the influence which true
faith exercises upon everything around
it, in his description of how the mind
acts on <em>latent</em> principles—how an
unexpressed remembrance or anticipation
runs through actions and
thoughts which have no direct connection
with it; and how hopes, of
which we were not even thinking,
sway and move us, invisible and
silent agents in our commonest
ways. We recommend this portion
of his sermon to all thoughtful
readers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not a very usual fortune for
sermons in this day—but this one
has flashed into the heart of several
vexed questions, and surprised many
minds into involuntary unanimity—and
when we are told that we must
fight our battles with our religion,
and not for our religion’s sake
extend the conflict, it is a great
cheer and encouragement to us,
heavily labouring in the common
road, and unable to choose a more
exalted way. Surely Christianity,
of all things, has least need to be
timid; yet we fear that much pious
and well-intentioned training has
had the effect of conferring an additional
charm upon the world’s
blandishments—the charm of forbidden
pleasure—rather than of
encouraging the neophyte manfully
to pass them by. We have been half
saddened, half amused, many a time,
by a preacher’s terrified denunciation
of the irresistible attractions of some
theatre or assembly, which in truth
was the dullest sham of pleasure-making
that ever wearied man; and
it is sad to see often an incompleteness
and contraction in that life of
unmistakable piety which ought to
be the broadest, the most genial, and
the most fully furnished of all the
states of man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, we are all too apt, unconsciously
and by implication—despite its
being impracticable under present
circumstances, Popery having made
it dangerous—to take the life of the
eremite, self-contained and contemplative,
as the true type of the religious
life; and it is strange to hear
that we ourselves, astray among
the noise of cities, or bearing the
burdens of the soil, should be more
fit exemplars of God’s service than
any soul secluded in church or temple,
and safe from the vulgar dangers of
the world. Yet no one will be bold
enough to say that Mr Caird has not
established his position, and few
serious minds can refuse to respond
to this serious and powerful call upon
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>This sermon is admirably clear and
simple in its diction, as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>weighty in its matter; there is little
of the passion and vehemence of
oratory, but a great deal of power,
subdued and held within control;
and the grave plain language of the
preacher is luminous and dignified,
worthy of the theme. We are indebted
to Mr Caird for a manly exposition
of what is possible to common
people in everyday existence—triumphs
of faith and principle beyond
the reach of those who fly
from the combat and the agony,—and
grateful to his Royal hearers for sending
to us all a lesson which makes
no distinctions among us, either of
wise and unwise, or of great and
small.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. Here, by the way, let us cite in a foot-note a description of statuary from the
<cite>Golden Ass of Apuleius</cite>. It illustrates the mode of regarding sculpture in a very
realistic period. It is a description of the entrance-hall to Byrrhœna’s house.
“Conversing in this way, we had proceeded but a few paces ere we arrived at
Byrrhœna’s house. The hall was most beautiful, and had statues of the Goddess of
Victory, raised on pillars which stood at the four corners. The wings of the figures were
expanded; their dewy feet seemed to brush the surface of a rolling sphere, although
it moved not; and they looked not as if they were attached to it, but hovered in
the air. A statue of Diana, in Parian marble, occupied a level space in the middle
of the enclosure. The figure was singularly beautiful: the garments of the goddess
were blown back by the wind; she seemed in the act of running directly towards
you as you entered, and awed you by the majesty of her godlike form. Dogs supported
the goddess on either side, and these too were of marble. Their eyes were
fierce and threatening, their ears erect, their nostrils open, their jaws agape to
devour; <em>and had any barking been heard in the neighbourhood, you would have thought
it proceeded from their marble throats</em>. A thing, also, in which the excellent
sculptor had given proof of the most consummate art, was this, that the fore-feet
of the dogs, uplifted to their chests, were in the act of running, while the hind feet
pressed the ground. At the back of the goddess stood a rock wrought to resemble
a grotto, overgrown with moss, grass, leaves, and brushwood, with vines and shrubs
here and there; and the reflection of the statue gleamed from the polished marble
within the grotto. Over the extreme edge of the rock hung apples and grapes,
most exquisitely wrought, and in which art, rivalling nature, <em>had so counterfeited their
originals that you would have thought they might be gathered for eating, when fragrant
autumn had breathed upon them the tints of maturity</em>. And if, leaning forward, you
had beheld the streamlets, which gently rippled as they ran beneath the feet of the
goddess, you would have thought that, like clusters of grapes which hang from the
vine, <em>they too resembled real life in the faculty of motion</em>.</p>

little peculiarity of Cockney speech. There is an insane use of the relative pronoun,
which is of immense service. We cannot remember a good quotation from
the play-writers, but here is one from Thackeray:—</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. <cite>The Corsican Brothers</cite> is not an afterpiece, but to show what kind of writing is
allowed to pass in even so successful a melodrama, let me quote a single speech: “At

your command; use it, then, <em>as</em> if it were your own, and consider yourself <em>as</em> sincerely

Camp, <em>7th December 1854</em>:—“I think Liprandi’s army might have been not merely
routed, but annihilated, any time during the last month till the bad weather set in,
having placed itself in a perilous position; and of the two attacks on the fortress
the French is, or ought to be, the true one—ours merely auxiliary; but it would
be indiscreet to say so. But the campaign once finished, all such subjects will be
open to discussion.”—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>
